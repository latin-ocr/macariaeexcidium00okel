them by Marshal Schonberg and William, it would appear, as intimated in the Latin text, that
the Irish were “ insufficient'' and their opponents ‘⁶ superior in numbersfi The Duke speaks
of the Irish infantry at only ‘⁴ huit bataillons,'' and, in terming the engagement between the
Irish cavalry and that of the enemy, “ un combat fort izzegczlst' he adds, that it was so, “ tant
par le nombre d'esmdrmzs, que par le terrain qui etoit fort coupiu ἃ οὺ les ennemis avaient
fizit glisser de Z’z'nfimterie,’' or, in other wordS. had brought both cavalry and infantry to
bear upon cavalry only. And, as to the forces by which the Irish were compelled to retreat
from Old-Bridge towards Duleek, Lauzun tells uS, that the message brought to the King (who
was with him) respecting this reverse, after informing his Majesty, ‘⁶ que le passage d'Olde-
brige etait attaque et force‚'’ and “que milord Tirconnel l'avait dct'endu avec beaucoup de
valeur de sa personne et de son regiment‚” added, “mais que [lauze bataillons avec clia: ltuz'l
escadrons des ennemis avaient fait plier nos bataillons.'’ Thus, by what the Duke of Berwick
asserts, the combat of the Irish CAVALRY against that of Willialn would be “sort megala*
according to “le nombre d'escadrons,¹' διο. 3 and as to the INFANTRY of both parties, the Irish
battalions about Old-Bridge are spoken of by the Duhe as only eight, against twelue, according
to Lauzun, of William's‚ besides eiglzteen sqztmlrons of Williamite cavalry. On the conduct
of his countrymen, in reference to this passage of the Boyne by their oppoueuts, the Latin
translator of ColonelO'Kelly say5‚ in connexion with what he speaks of as the superior num—
bers of the latter, ‘¹ nor does this justify any imputation of cowardice or want of cnergy in the
men, nor of any failure of military skill in the officers.” And, upon the whole, οι· when con-
sidered as new levies, inferior in every sort of appointment, as well as iu number, to William's
Continental veterans, &c., that the Irish did not act badly in this quarte-r, according to Ber-
wick's assertion, “nous ne laissames pas de charge-r ἃ recharger dim sois,'' may be judged
hythe observation of the Marshal de Boufflers, in his letter to Louis XIV„ July lst, 1703,
on the battle of Eeckeren: ¹⁴ Il est bien difficile ῖι raniener (liat-fois a la charge des troupes

It has been shown, in the previous note, that the King was some miles away from his
centre at Old-Bridge, and from his right of cavalry nearer to Drogheda3 having marched
with Lauzun, the French contingent, and, in short, the greatest part of his force, to the left,
