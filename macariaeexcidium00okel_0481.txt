Of Ginkell's other infantry attack‚ across the bog, srom his centre, upon that portion of
St. Ruth·s centre, farther away from Urrachree, and nearer to Aughrim, the same Williamite
authority says, in reference to that last cited: “ W'hilst this was a doing here, Col. St. lolam,
Col. Tiffin‚ Lord George Hambleton, the Frenclzm, and several other Regiments, were march-
ing over below upon the same Bogg. The Irish, in the mean Time, laid so close in their
Dstches, that several were doubtful whether they had any Men at that Place or not: but they
were convinced of it at last3 for no sooner were the French, and the Rest, got within twenty
Yards, or less, of the Ditches, but the Irz'sli. tired most furiously upon the1n3 which our Men
as bravely sustained, and pressed forwards. tho they could scarce see one another for Smoak.
And now‚'' lie observes, “the Thing seemed so doubtful sor some Time, that the By-standers
would rather have given it on the Irish Side 3 sor they had driven our Foot in the Centre so
far back, that they were got almost in a Line with some of our Great Guns, planted near the
Bogg, which we had not the Benefit of at that Juncture, because of the Mixture of our Men
and thei1·s.''

Captain Parker, who was present in Ginkell’s army at the battle. adds of the Irish forces,
previous and up to the death of St. Ruth : “ They maintained their ground on the right and
in the center with great obstinacy and resolution, and repulsed our men in those places several
times witlz considerable Zoss''“. Nevertheless, owing to the circumstances to be mentioned in
the next note, such success did not exist, as Colonel O’Kelly has supposed to have existed, ‘¹ on
ALL sides,'' or on the Irish left wing, at Aughrim, as well as in their centre, along Kilcomedan
hill, and on their right wing, at Urrachree‘.
