mentions him as likewise “talzeing with him a great quantety of amunition &cu so that
instead of assistance during the Siege the Irish were weaken'd 11)· 1118111 111 their stores, which
might haue been necessary for their defence, 1110 indeed nster the Siege was raised the Duke
of Tirconnel 111-0131111 with Monsr Lausune to return most of the amunition back, which the
late consumption made 1118111 stand in present need of.''

This retreat os the French seems to have considerably increased the expectation, among
the higher cireles in England, of 1118 fall of Limericlt. Lord Ranelagh, writing froni London,
August 7111, 1690, 111 answer to two letters from the Irish Williaxnite Secretnry at W'ar, the
first from Cam-ich, the last from “the camp near Casl1e1‚'' says: ‘¹ 1 hope yf next will bear
date from Lime1·iel<; for Ι cannot think my countrynien will give you much trouble there,
when they once see your army, and know the King is at the head of it.’' Lortl, afterwards
the celebrated Duls‘e of, Marlborongh, likewise writing to the Irish Williamite Secretary at
War from Londoti, August 12111, 113110, observes: ¹⁴ Your nuse of the frenel] having left Lym-

The writer ofthis note has never niet, in official sources of information, with an)v trace of
such an agreement between William III. and the ane of Tyreonnelly as this alludetl to hy Colo-
1101 O'Kelly. From the under-cited authoritieS, it is evident, that William's delay, in march-
ing against Lhneriek, after the battle of the Boyne, may be adequately explained by the general
difficulties of his position, which rendered him uncertain when he might be obliged to quit
Ireland for England. These difficulties were,—disaffectio11 and conspiracy in Scotland and
England,—ve1·y few regular troops there, on account of the regiments having· been almost all
drawn away, to swell his arniy in Ireland‚—the defeat of the English and Dutch fleets, off
Beaehy-Head, by the French under Tourville, and deseents expected in several directions,—
the apprehension of some French frigates being detached to burn the shipping along the Irish
coasts containing· the supplies for his army in 1reland‚-and, on the Continent, the overthrow
of the Allied forces, under the Prince de WValdec-k, by the Freneh, under the Marshal de Lux-

embourg‚ at the battle of Fleurus k.
