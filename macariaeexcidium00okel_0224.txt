Nugent (the same who was afterwards created Lord Riverston by James II.) says, in an
unpublished letter to Lord Sunderland, among the manuscripts in the State Paper Office,
London, and dated Dublin, 23rd June, 16862-⁴· There are 5000 in this kingdome, who
were never outlawed‚ and out of theyre estates, yet cannot now by law be restored.” That
is. could not be restored to “ theyre estates‚'' as the law, under the Acts of Settlement and
Explanation, then stood.

The Lord Chancellor Clare, speaking in the Irish House of Lords, February lOth, 1800,
of the results of Cromwell's usurpation in Ireland, *⁴ as having redounded essentially to the
advantage of the British empire‚'' and then adding, ‘⁴ but admitting the principle in its
fullest extent, it is impossible to defend the Acts of Settlement and Explanation by which it
uas carried into effect‚” sums up the consequences of those Acts as follows :—“ Having thus,
in the first instance, vested three-fourths of the lands and personal property of the inhabi-
tants of this island in the King. Commissioners are appointed, with full and exclusive autho-
rity, to hear and determine all claims upon the general fund, whether of officers or soldiers,
sor arx-ears of pay, of adventurers, who had advanced money sor carrying on the war. or of
innocent Papists, as they are called. In other words, the old inhabitants of the island, who
had been dispossessed by Cromwell, not for having taken a part in the rebellion, but for their
attachment to the fortunes of Charles ΙΙ. Eut, with respect to this class of sufferers, who
might naturally have expected a preference of claim, a clause is introduced, by which they
are postponed, after a decree of innoeence by the Commissioners, until previous reprisal shall
be made to Cromwell's soldiers and adventurers, who had obtained possession of their inheri-
tance ...... Seven millions eight hundred thousand acres of land were set out, under the
authority of this Act, to a motley crew of English adventurers‚ civil and military, nearly to
the total exclusion of the old inhabitants of the island, many of whom, who were innocent ot'
the rebellion, lost their inheritance, as well from the difficulties imposed upon then] by the
Court of Claims, in the proofs required of their innocence‚ as from a deficiency in the fund for
reprisal to English adventurers, arising principally from a profuse grant made by the Crown to
the Duke of York ...... And thus,'' adds Lord Clare, ‘⁴ a new colony of new settlers, com-
posed of all the various sects which then infested England, Independents‚ Anabaptists‚ Sece-
ders, Brownists‚ Socinians‚ Millenarians, and Dissenters of every description, many of them
infected with the leaven of democraey, poured into Ireland, and were put into possession of
the ancient inheritanees of its inhabitants: and l speak with great personal respect of the
men, when I state, that a very considerable portion of the opulence and power of the king-
dom of Ireland centres at this day, in the descendants of this motley collection of English

adventurers“¹³.
