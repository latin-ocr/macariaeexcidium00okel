state, “that the Court of France was so disponding in the matter, that all the King could
say was not able to procure so much as a small supply of armes, auumition, &c., for Ire-
land, his Most Christian Majesty gaue all for lost in that Kingdom, sayd, It would be so much
throwne away to send any thing thither, and therefore all he thought fit to doe, was to dis-
patch some empty shipps to bring away his troops, and such as would come along with them ;
so that in conformety to this the King was forced to send an order to My Lord Tirconnel‚
to come away himself too if he judged it proper, and either name a Connnander in chief at
his departure, and bring with him as many as willing to accompany him, or otherwise to

make conditions for their remaining if they rather chose thaff'ffl.

Goucl retreatfrom the Boyne, made after Jnmes leaves his army, hy the Irislz cavalry, mid [he
French iufizntry, tu Duhlin.

Story, in connexion with James's infantry at the Boyne, notes, ‘⁶ The French were towards
the Left of their Army that Day„ and so (lid little 01* no Serviee, except it was in the Retreat.’'

The King himself, alluding to his arrival, on the retreat, with Lnuzun, at the pass of
Duleek, and to thejunction there with the rest of the army from Old-Bridge, &c., under the
Duke of Tyrconnell, says, respecting the conduct of the Irish horse and French infantry, on
that occasion: ‘⁶ Tyrconnel joined Lausnn as he was passing, at which time the Enemie ap-
pear'd and offer'd to attack their reer, but they turn‘d upon them with some hors and the
French f00t‚ and made so good a countenance that they suffer'd them to pass quietly over the
brook, and bring five (of the Six pieccs of Cannon) which attended the left wing, the other
being boged was lost3 from thence they made their retreat to the Neal, an other great defilt‘: in
good order, the enemie however waiting still on them without pressing upon them, and at
last, when night came, follow'd no more.'’

The Duke of Berwick, mentioning the sanie retreating junctum, at the “brock'' or “ ruis-
scau de Duleek,” of the lrish centre under Tyrconnell, and right wing of cavalry under him-
self, with the left under the King and Lauzun, states,—“ J'arrivai avec ma cavale1·ie,justement
comme les dernieres troupes du Roi passoient le ruisseau ; mais celles du Prince d’Orange, qui
s’avancoient toujours, y arriverent presque en meme temps; de maniere que je sus oblige de
passer le defile au grand galop δι en confusion z nous nous ralliames de l'autre cote, δι toute
notre armee s'y rangea en bataille. Les ennemis en firent autant vis-a-vis de nous, mais n'ose-
rent nous attaquer. Apri-s quelque peu de temps, nous nous remimes en marche, ἃ* ffimes
suivies par partie de l'armee ennemie ; toutes les fois qu'a quelque defile nous saisions halte,
ils en faisoient de meme, ἃ* je crois qu'ils etoient bien aises de nous faire un pont d'or.''
