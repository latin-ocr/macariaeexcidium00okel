Abundance ef other Things all at this Time upon the Road from Dublz'n, under the Care of
two Troops of Colonel Viller's Horse’'—that the day after the English “got to Limericlr, a
Frenelzman (as was reported) a Gunner owf theirs, ran away from them into Town, and gave
the Enemy an Account where the Train lay, as also of those Guns and other Things that
were coming up''—and that on Monday, August llth, 111 the morning, “came one Alanus
O'Brien, a substantia] Country Gentleman to the Camp, and gave Notice that Sarsfielcl in the
Night had passed the River with a Body of Herse, aud design’d Something extraordinary‚''-
the matter is related thus :

“ When Sar-§field heard what the Frenclemcm had told, 116 was pretty sure, that if those
Guns, Boats, and other Materials came up to us, the Town would nothe able to hold out3 and
therefore 116 resolves to run a Hazzwd, and desti-oy them 111 their March, if it were possible ;
if he succeeded, then he broke our Measures ; but if not, then 116 designed for France, if he
did but survive the Attenipt: In order to which, he takes all the best Horse and Dragoons that
were 111 Town, and that very Night lnarches over the Slumnon, 111 a Place called Isillalow, a
Bishop's See on the Slzannon, Twelve Miles above our Canip. The Messenger that brought
the News was not much taken Notice of at first, most People looking upon it 115 11 Dreain ε Α
Great Offieer however called him aside, and after some indifferent Questions, 115111 111111 about
a Prey of Cattel, in such a l'laee3 which the Gentleman complain'd of afterwards, saying, he
was sorry too see Gener-al Officers mind Cattel 111016 1111111 1116 King's Honour. But after he
met with some Aequaintance, he was brought to the King, who, to prevent the worst, gave
Orders that a Party of Five hundred Horse should be made ready, and march to meet the
Guns: But whether his Majesty's Orders were not delivered to the Officer 111 Chief that was
to command the Party, or where the Fault lay, Ι 11111 110 competent Judge: but it was
certainly One or Two ofthe Cloek in the Morning before the Party marohed, which they did
111611 very sostly, till about an Hour after they saw a great Light 111 the An, and heard 11
strange rumbling Noise, which some conjectur'd to be the Train blown up, as it really was.
For on Szmday Night our Guns lay at Caslzell, 111111 011 Illzcnclay they marehed beyond Cnllen,
to a little old ruinous Castle, called Bnllenecly, 1101 seven Miles from our Camp, and directly
in the Rear of it, where they encamped on a small Pieee of plain green Ground, there being
several Earthen Fenoes on 0116 Side, and the old Castle on the other: If they had feared the
least Danger, it had been 611516 10 draw the Guns and every Thing else within the Ruins of
that old Castle, and theu it had been diffieult for an Army, much more a Party, to have
touched them: Nay, it was easie 10 place them and the Carriages 111 such a Figure upon the
very Spot where they stood, that it had been certain Death to have come nigh them3 bnt
thinking themselves at Home, 50 nigh the Cauip, and not searing an Enemy in such a place, espe-
cially since they had no Notice sent then] ofit ; they turn'd most of their Horses out to Grass,
as being wearied with marching before, and the Guard they left was but a very slender one,
the Rest most of them going to Sleep 3 but some of them awoke in thessnext World3 for Sar-field
all that Day lurked amongst the Mountains, and having Notice where, and how our Men lay,
he had those that guided him through By-ways to the very Spot, where he fell 111 amongst
them before they were aware, and cut several of them to Pieces, with a great many of the
