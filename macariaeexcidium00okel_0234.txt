The Prince of Orange, in the first Declaration issued by him, October 10, 1688, from the
Hague, before his embarkation for the invasion of England, observes, with respect to the
recent birth of the King's son ;-“ But, to erown all, there are great and violent presumptionis
inducing us to believe, that those evil counsellors, in order to the carrying on of their ill de-
signs. and to the gaining to themselves the more time for the effeeting of them, for the encou-
ragine· of their complices, and for the discouraging of all good subjeets‚ have published, that
the Queen hath brought forth a son 3 though there hath appeared, both during the Queen's
pretended bigness, and in the manner in which the birth was managed, so manyjust and visi-
hle grounds of suspicion, that not only we ourselves, but all the good subjects ofthose king-
(101115. do vehemently suspect. that the pretended Prince of Wales was not born by the Queen.
And it is notoriously known to all the world, that many both doubted of the Queen's bigness,
and of the birth of the child3 and yet there was not any one thing done to satisfy thern, or to
put an end to their ‹loul)ts.‘' Then, having stated, ‘⁶ since our dcarest and most entirely be-
loved consort, the Prinoess, and likewise curs-elves. have so great an interest in this matter,
and such a right, as all the world knows, to the success-ion to the Crown,‘' that for those and
many other reasons (not necessary, and too long here to mention). it was his intention to in-
vade. England, to obtain a redress of its grievances by means of *⁴ a free and lawful parliament,
assembled as soon as possible,'' he adds: ‘⁴ To this Parliament we will also refer the inquiry
into the birth of the pretended Prince of Wales, and of all things relating to it.'' To the
Parliament, however, or any other public tribunal. no inquiry of the kind was ever referred ;
hut, in the words ofJames's Memoirs, ‘⁴ the Prince of Orange‚l1aveing brought about what he
aim'd at by that and other calumnys, let them moulder away when he had no further use for
thern ;'' the misrepresentations respecting the Prince of Wales's birth being, according to the.
same authority, such, that “indeed none but a people accostomed to belieue the sables of t‘orty-
une, and the contradictions os Oates's plot, could reconcile.'’

“ It would be needless.'' observes Mr. Jesse, after noticing the different party fictions on
this matter, “to detail the various and unanswerable arguments, which refute the idle theory
ofa surreptitious birth. It would be alone a sufficient refutation, that. besides the necessary
attendants, there were present, at the Queen's delivery, sorty-two persons of rank, eighteen
ofthe Privy Council, four other noblemen, and twenty ladies, all of whom, as sar as eircum-
stances and modesty would allow, were witnesses of the birth of the Prince of Wales. By the
desire ofJames‚ the depositions of these persons were taken down, and may still be seen, with
the autographs of the deponents, in the Council Office ..... No person. indeed, who was
ever introduced to the Pretender,—as he was afterwards invidiously styled.—who had pre-
viously been acquainted with the features and character of his misguided father, ever, for a
moment, questioned, that he was the genuine offlpring os King James.'' See Note 45.

How very opposite was the popular feeling in Ireland to that in England, on the delivery
of the Queen, is described as follows, in a contemporary Williamite pamphlet:—“ Now comes
into Ireland one Captain Bridges, who rid post to bring the happy news of the birth of the
supposed Prince of wales: for which he received the honour of knighthood, by the sirname
