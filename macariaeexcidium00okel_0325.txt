the 29th, and submission on the 30th, of March, 1603, to the English Lord Deputy Mountjoy,
some days aster the ‹lecease of the Queen, which took place the 24111.

Speaking of Hugh O'NeIIl's situation so far back as early in September, 1602, Moryson
observes: ‘⁶ Tyrmie, Briau Mat-Art, Mac Mulwwnd, and (jun-mark Mac Barron. were fled
into the bottome ofa great Fastnesse towards the end of Longlz Erue, whom his Lordship
(Mountjoy) followed as farre as hee could possibly carry the Ariny, yet came not within twelue
miles of them, besides, they had a way from thence into Orztrke's Country (Leitrim), to
which the Army could not passe.'’ Then, amongst other matters, Moryson adds z “ Tyr-one
and his abouenamcd confederates were all poore, and all the Rebels following them were not
abone six hundred foote, and sixtie horse.”

O'Sullivan's representation of O’Nei11·s position, under the circumstances above specified‚
is as follows: “Quadringentis tantum militibus stipatus in Conkeiniam densam vallem se
abdit, ibiq; tutari conatur. Eius municipia ab hoste incendsitur, ἃ segetes exciduntur,
ducibus itineru, δι ope Anglo ferentibus Quinto & HGrico Onellis Iohfinis principis filijs‚
quos Tironi multi sequebantur. Sulphur, & munitiones, quae Pati-itius Odonilius firmo mu-
nimento & przesidio custodiebat, inmotis imposita ad regios defert. Hoc tcpoie anno ia
millesimo sexcentesimo tertio Elizabetha Angliae Regina ἓ vita discessit, a qua moriente
Angliae consilium facultatem percutiendi cum Onello foederis impetrat. Et Onellus quidem
&si hostem vallis aditu duplici prospera velitatione prohibuit, tamen consumptis facultatihuS,
munitionibusque amissis, vndique circumuentus, auxilij spe destitutus, δι ignorans Reginam
esse fato functam, pacis conditiones accipit.''

According to the same writer, O'Neill was unlucliy in more respects, than in not having
known of Elizabeth's death on the 24111 of March. 1603, when he surrendered himself on the
29th. “ Rex Hispaniae Philippus III. Martinum Cerdam (D. Mareia de Za Cei-da) legatum
cum duabus nauibus sulphuris Sc aliarum munitionum plenis & triginta. millibus aureorum
nummorum ad Onellum, δι Rothericum (O'Donnell) mittit, qui si prius id subsiclij accepis-
sent, arma proculdubio non deposuissent, illis vers] depositiS‚ Regis pecuniam ᾗ· φηῖιηὶίὶοηρκ
accipere naluerunt.” This too late arrival of assistance (like that from France, at the end of
the Williamite war, after the terms of the Treaty of Limerick had been agreed upon.'¹) may
explain much ot' what Moryson relates of the effect of the news of Elizabeth‘s death on
O‘Neill, when he was told of it, after his suri-entier, by Lord Mountjoy3 who, having been
aware of the fact, was the more anxious to conclude the Irish war, by the suhmission of its
leader. “ I cannot,'' says Moryson, “omit to mention, that the Earle os Tyrcae, vpon the
first hearing the Lord Deputies relation of the Queenes death, could not containe himselfe
from shedding of teares, in such quantity as it could not well be concealed, especially in him,
vpon whose sace all mens eyes were cast z himselfe was content to insinuate, that a temler sor-
row for losse of his Soueraigne Mistresse‚ caused this passion in him.‘' However, it is added,

‘¹ there needed no Oedipus to find out the true cause of his teares: for no doubt, the most
humble
