at the tenth year of 115 existenee; and though it 11115 been the 111011115 of
creating a genuine antiquarian spirit 111 1110 country, 111111 of producing a 501105
of 1110511111111110 works, yet 115 performances have hitherto been the 1051111 of
combined effert, and it 11115 not, up to the present, been made the vehicle of
individual liberality. No one who 1105 seen the 1111011501110 volume lately pre-
sented to the members of the Bannatyne Cluh by Mr. Chalmers, of Auldbar,
01111 refrain from wishing that a like spirit of generosity prevailed in Irehmd,
where monumental and literary 111111111111105 111-0 111 511011 rich abundance, 111111
where nothing 15 wanting to give 115 arehaeology a European reputation but

that 115 11111111 anniversary 1110011111,Τ 15 about to be held, Ι take 1110 opportunity
of making, through you, a 111-01105111 whieh I hope will 110 favourably enter-

account of a visitation of the (1100050 of Derry, held by Primate Colton in the
year 1397, which contains a great deal os eurious ecclesiastical information,

mate having kindly given me 11011111551011 10 publish 11, 111111 having 11150 allowed
me 1100055 to the original roll, which 15 preserved among 1110 private 10001115 of
the 500, Ι have made a eareful 1111115011111, and have prepared 511011 110105 115

it 115 50011 115 I have made a few references 10 authorities in Dublin, which I
hope 10 110 immediately after Clu-istiuas. The work will be but 511011, extend-
