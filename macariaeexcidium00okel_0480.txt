their Ditches stoutly ; for they would maintain one Side, till our Men put their Pieces over at
the other, and then having Lines of 001111111111101111011, from one Ditch to another, they would
presently post themselves again, and flank us.'' ⁸

According to the extract from the Williamite Chaplain, given in the last Note, “this occa-
sioned great Firing 011 both Sides‚‘’ while Ginlzell's arrangements were going on to bring into
action the rest of the two armieS, or their respective eentreS, and the opposite wings at Augh-
rim. Nor, until “near two Hours,” reckoncd‚ as has been seen, from about half-past six,
or, in other words, until about half-past eight dcloch, does Story claim any greater advan-
tage for Ginkell's troops at Urrachree, than that, as he says, “ those towards om· Left‚ that
first Engaged, kept their Grozmcl,·'—and‚ it may be added, were only able, at most, to do so
there until after the death of St. Ruth, as will appear from Captain Purher, and a comparison
of the preceding particulam, as to time, with the period 10 which Colonel O'Kelly assigns
the sall of the Freneh General.

Of Ginkell's infantry attack across the hog, from his contre, upon that portion of St. Ruth‘s
centre nearest to Urvachree, Story gives this account z ‘⁴ Colonel Era-l, Colonel Herbert,
Colonel Creigltton, and Colonel Brezcer’s Regiments went over at the narrowest Place, where
the HedgeS, on the Enemies Side, run furthest into the Bogg. These four Regiments were
ordered to march to the lowest of the Ditches, adjoining to the Side of the Bogg, and there
to post themselves, till our Horse could come about by Aghrim Castle, and sustain them, and
till the other Foot had marched over the Βορῆς below, where it was broader, and were sus-
tained by Col. Fuulls's, and Brigadeer Stemzrt's. Col. Earl advanced with his Regiment. and
the Rcst after him, over the Bogg, and a Rivulet that ran through it, being most of them
up to their Middles in Mudd and Water. The Irish, at their near Approach to the Ditches,
tired upon them, but our Men contemning all Disadvantages, advanced immediately to the
lowest Hedges, and beat the Irish from thence. The Enemy however did not retreat far, but
posted themselves in the next Ditches before us: which our Men seeing‚ and disdaining to
suffer their Lodging so near us, they would needs beat them from thence also, and so from
one Hedge to another, till they were got very nigh the Enemies main Battel. But the Irish
had so ordered the Matter, as to make an easie Passage for their Horse, amongst all those
Hedges and Ditehes, by which they poured in great Numbers both of Horse and Foot upon
us: which Colonel Earl seeing‚ encouraged his Men, by advancing before them, and saying,
There was no Way to come qffbut lo be Brave. As great an Example of true Courage and
Generosity as any Man this Day living. But being both flanked and fronted, as also exposed
to all the Enemies Shot from the adjacent Ditches 3 our Men were forced to quit their Ground
and betake themselves to the Bogg again, whither they were followed, or rather drove down

by main Strength of Horse and Foot‚ and a great many killed. Colonel Earl, and Colonel
Herbert,
