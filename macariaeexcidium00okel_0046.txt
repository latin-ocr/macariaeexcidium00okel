qum'cms, who had sacrificed, for his sake, their fortunes and their expec-
tations, were excluded from all participation in a munificence, extended
even to some of the instigators of his father's murder. And thus it was
that, under the sway of Pgstlzagyorccs, they were lcft to groan under the
same disabilities and oppressions, to which thc cruel Amfllas and the rebel-
lious Senate had condemned them, in all the insolence of their power.
This was universally looked on, as a most ungrateful return, for such
constant loyalty, and unshaken fidelity. .

14. But Pytlzayoras, immersed in his pleasurcs, and a slave to his
slothful and inglorious indulgence, transferred the grave cares of empire
and the weight of public business to a few ofhis familiars, who, heed-
less of anything but their private advantage, neglected the public wel-
fare of the kingdom. Nor can any empire stand, and, firmly based, bid
defiancc to every storm, where justice does not flourish, and, with strict
balance, mete to each his due. Five and twenty years did Pythagsorczs
reign, and had no issue by the illustrioris partner of 1115 bed, though, by
his various mistmsses, he left a numerous progeny, a burden to the state
at the moment, and a fertile source of rebellion for the future. Hc died,
from the effects of a violent illncss, not unregretted by the Illartmzensisms
in particular, who were very much alai-med lest Amasis, to whom thc

ad nonnullos etiam ex paternae eaedis Authoribus clementia} et liberalitatis ex-
sortes fuerunt: atque adeo Pythagora rerum potiente iisdem aerumnis et cala-
mitatibus oppressi gemuerunt, quibus illos crudelis Attilam, et rebellis impo-
tentia Senatus damnaverant. Indignissima sane omnium mortalium judicio,
tam constanti animorum affectu, tamque immota fide merces.

14. Pythagoras autem voluptatibus immersus, et segni atque imbelli otio
deditus, in paucos ex familiaribus graves-imperii curas et negotiorum molem
transtulit, qui privatis utilitatibus inhiantes, publica regni commoda neglex-
ere: quod nunquam stare et primis radicibus niti potest, nisi ubi justitia
floret, et equa lance suum cuique tribuitur. Quinque et viginti annos regna-
vit Pydzayoras, nulla prole suscepta ex egregia thori Consorte: ex Concubinis
vero numerosam sobolem reliquit, regno in praesens gravem, idemque ali-
quando distracturam: violento morbo correptus obiit, non indefletus‚ Marta—
