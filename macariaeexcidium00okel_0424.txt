According to Collins, the Duke of Grafton was appointed Yice-Admiral of England,
December 21111, 1632. 111 that capacity, he had under his uncle‘s reign, or in 1687, observes
the same writer, “the command osa squadron of his Majesty‘s ships of war, to receive Mary
Sophia, Queen of Pedro IL, King of Portugal, in Holland, and conduct her to Lisbon. ‘His
Grace afterwards sailed for Tunis, where he arrived on October loth, 1687, and having
brought the Corsairs of that place to amity, he returned to England in March, 1688, and,
waiting on the King, was very graciously received.'' It would, however, appear by what
King James states in connexion with the Duke‘s death at the siege of Cork, that his not
having been elevated to a still higher rank in the navy contributed to make him desert to the
Prince of Orange, some months after, at the Revolution. His Majesty, in remarking upon
the fall of the Duke, thus adds respecting him: “ who after haveing treclnrously abandon'd
the King, who Ioved him like a father, had no other recompence from the Vsurper thau to be
knockesl in the head in his service in quality of a Volunteer: he who thought himselfso highly
injured because the King had not given him the command of the Fleet, preferable to all the
antient and experieneed Officers in the Kingdom.’' Dulrymple, too, asserts of the Duke: “ He
had asked the command ofthe fleet iu place of Lord Dartmouth‚ bnt James had refused his
request. Either irritated, 01· inflamed with the love of liberty, he went privately to the fleet,
and obtained a promise from two-thirds ofthe Captains, that they would not oppose the Princo
of Orange, and informed the Prince of what he had done.'’

Though Colonel O'Kelly speaks of the Duke as a warm supportet· of the Protestant saith,
and a proportionable hater or persecutor of the Irish for their attachment to the Roman
catholic Church, from such circumstances connected with religion as are related of the Duke,
he does not seem to have been a man of much religious consistency, or principle. Thus, when,
in 1657, the Duke of somerset, as Lord of the Bedchamber, was stripped ot* his appointment
by James, for ⁸⁴ having,'' says Collins, “ declIned conducting Ferdinand Duddu, Archbishop of
