Thongh Roderic is said not to have been intimidated by the unjust Bull of Adrian IV.,
because it was the production of an Englishman, there may, if the King knew of the docu-
ment, have been another reason, for such an alleged disregard of that Bull, on his part. The
famous Irish manifesto of Donald O'Neill‚ &c., to Pope John XXII„ describes all the Milesian
Monarchs of Ireland, from the introduction of Christianity, although great benefactors to
their Church, yet as “nullum in temporalibus recognoscentes superiorem.” But whatever
may have been Roderic's ideas respecting the pretensions of the Court of Rome to temporal
power in Ireland, he appears to havc so far differed in his conduct from the churchmen of
his lintion, as to have refused to attend upon, and do homage to, Henry while he was in Ire-
land; notwithstanding the example previously related to have been given, in that respect, by
the four Archbishops of Ireland and their suffragan Bishops-including even the Primate and
subordinate Prelates of the kingdom of Connaught··.

The Anglo-Normans did not wait until Roderic O'Conor's decease to invade Connaught.
Although Roderie is alleged not to have violated the treaty previously mentioned as having
been concluded between him and Hem-y in 1175 at Windsor, yet, in 1177, under the viceroy-
alty of William Fstz-Aldfflm, Miles de Cogan, on the invitation of Roderie‘s son, Morrogh
(or Murtagh)‚ who had rebelled against his father, marched, with ahostile force, from
Dublin into Connaught. The inhabitants, however, remained loyal to their old King; Cogan,
after advancing as far as Tuam, found himselfobliged to retreat3 Roderic, waiting for him, upon
his return near a wood, attacked him; and, amongst the loss of the invaders, was meogh,
who, being taken, was, according to a punishment then practised in Ireland, England, and on
the Continent, condemned to lose his eyes·¹. Some time after, Roderie retired into the mo-
