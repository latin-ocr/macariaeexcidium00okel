upon the Roscomon Side3 this is a good Pass, and the Irislz might have given us some
Trouble in gaining it; but that they had found out a much better Plaoe, as will soon
appear.‘'

On St. Ruth's impatience to come to an engagement after the loss of Athlone, the Duke
of Berwick observes, that “ etant fache δι honteux du mauvais succes qu'il avoit eu a Athlone,
il se determina a combattrff· And, continues the Duke, ‘⁶ il eut bientot ce qu'il souhaitoit;
car les ennemis voyant que le debouche d'Athlone etoit libre, marcherent droit a lui'’⁰.

Sarsfield and the majority ofthe J acobz'te Officers gravely set forth in opposition, how Ginkell‘s
army was superior both in numbers and discipline ; his troops being mostly vetet-ans, whom
Willz'um Ιιαά eulz'sted not only from Germany, but from Denmark, Sweden, and the Nemer-
londs,· and had Zikcwz'se strengthened by α considerable body ofProtestonts out ofFrcmce,

Of the comparative numbers of the Irish and English armies for the battle of Aughrim,
Story says: “ The Line of Battle will direct you how many Regiments we had in the Fight,
and considering all Cheumstances, they could not make up 17‚000 Horse ancl Foot. The Irislz‚''
he adds, “ were nigh 20‚000 Foot and 5000 Horse and Drzwoons, as appears from the most
Rational Accounts, that can be gathered from the Number of their Regiments, and the Con-
fessz'on of their own Officers.’'

The Williamite account of the battle of Aughrim in the Lomlou Ga:ette expresses itself.
in this manner, respecting the numbers of the two armies: “ Their Army was superior to
ours in Number, consisting of ‘20‚000 Foot, and &000 Horse and Dragoons.''

Bishop Burnet‚ who is acknowledged by Story to have corrected and furnished informa-
tion for his history, though setting down the Irish at Aughrim as having been 28‚000 men, yet
rates the English army at about 3000 more than Story, or 20‚000 men. ‘⁴ My Lord Bishop of
Salisbury‚¹' observes the VVilliamite Chaplain, ‘⁴ has been pleased, not only to commend the
Undertaking, but to honour me with the Correction of some of my Papers with his own Hand,
and also with an Account of the Reasons for some Particulars, that before I was in the Dark
for Want of.’' The Bishop's words, relative to the strength of the two armies, are: ‘⁵ He
(St. Ruth) retired to Aghrim ; where he posted himself to great Advantage, and was much
superior to Ginkle in Number ; sor he had abandoned many small Garrisons to increase his
Army, which was now 28,000 strong3 whereas Ginkle had not above 20,000.·'

As connected with this enumeration of the two armies by the Bishop, and that likewise
given from the London Gazette, M. de la Brune, who dedicates his Williamite account in
French of the campaign of 1691 to Ginkell himselfv, appears to have rated William III.'s
