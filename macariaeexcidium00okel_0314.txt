282 Notes and I llustrations.

The causes, to which, under such circumstances, English power has been considered as
indebted for existing at all in Ireland, are thus explained by Dr. Leland, under the reigns of
Henry V. and Henry V1.‚ or between 1413 and 1471. Having noted, under the former
reign, respecting the old Irish Chieftains and their 013115, that “they were contented‚ in the
distant quarters of the island, to rule their petty septs, to maintain their state and consequence
against their neighbours‚ to enjoy the honour and advantage of triffing victories, to execute
their revenge, or to pursue their local interests.''-that ‘⁶ their aversion to the English was,
by this time, scarcely inore national‚ than their aversion to the rival septs oftheir own race,'’..
and that, “ had the whole Irish race arisen as one man against the subjects of the crown of
EnglamL they must have instantly destroyed them‚” &zo-the Doctor says of those English
subjects: ‘⁶ But the trnth is, this little handful ofmen, for such they were, when compared to
the body of original natives, had the same ground of security with any of the particular Irish
septs. They had enemies at all sides, but these were enemies to each other, nor were any
concerned to espouse the quarrels of their neighbours‚ or mortified by their defeats. Some-
times, indeed, when a particular sept was in danger of total ruin from the victory of some
English forces, their neighbours were persuaded to come to their rescue, ἰχῶ-1119311118 of
tlze Iris-lc Zngzmge' (as the manuscript annals express it), but without engaging further, and
without conceiving themselves bound by one general, permanent interestfi Then, or under
the next reign, having remarked of the English in Irehznd, how their ‘⁶ only method to secure
peace and protection was to trent with the turbulent Irish ehieftains as superiors‚'·-and how
consequently, in the North and South, such ‘⁴ chieftains received annual tribntes from their
English neiglibours,”—the Doctor adds of those Irish potentates: “Their pride was fully
gratified by what they deemed the great mark of sovereignty‚ and the English, as a particular
sept, were suffered to live uninolested, under the protection of other particular septs, who
pursued their own private contests undisturbed‚ with a fastidious disregard of the affairs of
the Saxous (as they were called).'‘

Meantime, the English, first, in their long war against France, and, next, in that between
the two roses, were occupied, with about as little policy as profit on their part‚—the former
contest, or that to place their King on the throne of Franco, only tending, if successful, to
render England subordinate to France, since there, as being the Zarger kingdom of the two, a
Sovereign of' both should reside‚—the latter contest, or that between the rival dynasties of
York and Lancaster, so far resembling the hostilities of the Irish against one another, as to
be one of English against English, for mutual destruction.

That the power of the Pale, which (to speak in general terms) was supposed to consist of
the districts of Louth (or Uriel), Meam, Kildare, and Dublin, continued to decline, while
the tributes paid to the Irish Chieftains increased, until a later period, or the year 1515,
appears by the State Papers of the reign of Henry VIII. ‘⁴ Ther is,’' observe those docu-
ments, “no Folke dayly subgett to the Kinges Lawes, but Half the Countye of Uryell, Half
the Countye of Meam, Half the Countye of Dublyn‚ Half the Countye of Kyldare.” Of these,
it is noted,—“ All the eomyn Peoplle of the said Halff Countyes, that obeyeth the Kinges

Laws, for the more Part ben of Iryshe Byrthe, of Iryshe Habyte‚ and of Iryshe Langage.''
