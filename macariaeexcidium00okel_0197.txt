James, compared with the Lonclon Gazette of William, very good means could have been
obtained for narrating in detail the events of the Irish war ; though, so far as the existence,
at present, of any file, or even single copy, os that Dablm Gazette (for which the writer ofthis
note has scarched in vain), such means, unfortunately‚ no longer exist. King James's admi-

berty of the press was very imperfectly enjoyed in
Engkmd, and during avery short period. The Star
Chamber, while that Court subsisted, put effectual
restraints upon printing. On the suppression of
that tribunal in 1641, the. Long Parlfflment, after
the rupture with the King, assumed the sanie
power, with regard to the licensing of books; and
this authority was continued, during all the period
of the Republic and Protectorship. Two years
after the Restoration, an Act was passed, reviving
the republican ordinances. This Act expired in
1⁴579; but was revived in the first of ang James.

freedom, doubted much of its salut-ary effects, and
probably thought, that no books would ever so much
improve the general understanding of men, as to
