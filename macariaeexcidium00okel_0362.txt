very ill.'' Finnlly, having mentioned the placing of his troops in winter-quarters, the King
adds, on the losses of his enemies, in this campaign: “Thus the Campagne ended very much
to the King's honour and advantage -, two partes of the Enemie's Army¹ was destroy’d at Laud,
andan infectious distemper had got into the English Fleet, which in conjunction with the
Dutch had a designe upon Corke, bnt their men dying so fast were forced to lay aside that
enterprise, and soon after the French kept them So much in awe, that they dnrst attempt no-
thing more that year ..... The miserable diseases which affected the Enemie's Camp accom-
panyed with all the nautious circomstances of nastiness, infection, and lice, which swan-med
not only in the houses, but upon the very boils of trees where the sick persons had laine, was
a visible mark of God's judgment upon that wicked and Rebellious generation.''

The Jacobite official account, published in Dublin, after the termination of the campaign
0f1689, by Mai-shal Schonberg's evacuation of Dundalk, and retreat into Ulster, speaks of
the results of that campaign, in a very different way from Colonel O'Kelly.

“ The Mighty Expectations of the Great Sclzomberg and his Rebellious Adherents,'' says
that account, “ being thus Deseated, he Marched into the Nortlz of Ireland towards Befflzst,
with the weak Remainder of his Army, being fliminis-kt much above one Half, by extream
Sickness, and Want of necessary Subsistance, tho' he had a Fleet to attend him, and a whole
Province behind him.

“ The Success of this Campaign‚'' continues the account, “has no ways been answerable
