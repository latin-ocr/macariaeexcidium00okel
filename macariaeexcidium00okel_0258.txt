The translator of the Lodbrokar Quida, or celebrated Death Song of King Ragnar Lod.
brog, the piratio Hercules of the Scandinavian nafions, observes, in a note on that composi-
tion :-“ The fertile Erin was long the great resort of the scandinaviam, who, from the in-
ternal dissensions of the natives, gained a considerable footing. They, however, met with a
stubborn resistance. Hence, the Islandie authors represent the Irish as most profuse of life,
and the Irafitr was no less terrible to the sons of Lochlin, than ὡρίων-07·Νυνηιαηηονῑιηι to the
rest of Europe-'¹

The best proof, however, of what a counterpoise the Irafar was to thefuror IVormamzo-
rwn is supplied by the fact that, although a comparatively small force of that fierce raee,
“ adversus quos‚“ says an old French writer, “ nullus rex, nullus dux, nullus defensor surrexit
qui eos expugnaret,” were so much dreaded as to obtain, early in the tenth century, from the
descendant of Charlemagne, that considerable portion of France, in which, under their leader,
Rolf or Rollo, they founded the powerful feudal sovereignty of Norman‹ly‚—and although
their Danish brethren. under Sven or Swayn, the father of Knut or Canute, and their two
royal suecessors, triumphet] over and reigned in England from 1013 to 1042‚-the same race

¹ “ It, may here be worthy of remark‚'' says Mr.

D. Η, Kelly, “that O’Kelly is the only Irish family
that presel-ves any hev-aldit· memorial of that inte-
resting condiet. The erest of O'Kelly, the ssm-
plss‘o, is founded on the tradition, that, on the morn-
ing of Clontarf battle, Holy Friday‚ 23rd April,
1014, a kind of yreen lun-se, or strange manifold
animal. seeming to rise from the sea, rushed through
the ranks of the Danes, and continued on into those
of the Hyinaine clans, in which he see-med to take
refuge ; and, that Teigue O'Kelly, taking advantage
of this event to animate his troops, cried out to
them, ⁶ that this animal was a forerunner of vic—
tory.'-It is said, also, that, after Teigue fell, the
same animal again appeared to protect his body
against the insults of the enemy, till brought off
from the field by his elan. This erest is still borne
by the O'Kellys, aud was the erest of the Author
of the ‘ Macaria? Exeidium! '¹
