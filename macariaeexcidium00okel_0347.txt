Lord Illountcashel'sforce, both horse and foot, owing to their being mostly new lenies, and lo (ι
great error by α subordinate Officer in commandlng his men, are easily defeated at N ewton-
Butler.

King James's Memoirs state of his troops, in this unfortunate affair, ¹‘ the King's hors
soon giveing way, the rest were totally routed.'' Story, who, as Chaplain to one of William
111.’s Regiments during the war in Ireland, had good opportunities for collecting military
information there, says, in reference to the little difficulty and small loss with which the En-
nislzilliners were represented to have beaten the 1rish,on this occasion 2 ‘⁵ This Story seem'd
to me at first very Incredible3 but I was told, it partly hapned by a Fatal Mistake in the Word
of Command amongst the [rislu- for the Inislcillizz-men charged the lrish Right Wing very
smartly, which sslaclearty percciving, ordered some of his Men to face to the Right, and march
to relieve their Friends, the Officer that received the orders, mistook, and commanded the
Men, instead os facing to Right‚ to sace to the Right about, and so march3 the Irish in
the Reer seeing their Front look with their Faces towards them, and move, thought they
had been running, and so without more ade, threw down their own Arms, and run away;
the Rest seeing their Men run in the Reer, run after thern for Company, and were most of them
cut off, or drowned in Boggs and Loughs; so unhappy may a small Thing· prove to a great
Body of Men: and at other Times a little Thing in Appearance proves very advantageous:
For we read of a Roman at Plough, who stood with his Ox-yoke in a Gap, and stopt the
Soldiers that were running away; this made them face about, and win the Field, though, I
believe, in that Action of the Im'skillinerx, as well as Der-ry, there was a great Deal due to
their Valour, and more to the Providenee of God‘'². &Valter Harl-is, in his Life of King
William 111.‚ and Dr. Leland, in his History20f 1reland, both of whom read the contemporary
Williamite work ot* Story, have nevertheleSS, in their accounts of this Newton-Butler affair,
been totally silent respecting the “ Fatal Mistake in the Word ofCommand amongst the Irish.''

Lord hlountcashel, having (lone every thing that became α εἷῑίζῖιιῖ and gallam} Officer, is dis-
mowzted, severely woundezl, and brought, as α prisoner, to Ennishillen.

The Jacobite joui-nal observes, of Lord Mountcashel’s conduct on this fatal day, that
“ he did all a brave man could do,'’ but “ was wounded and taken prisoner, forsaken by all
his regiment, which was,with the most part of the foot, cut off, while they were fiying.” The
royal Memoirs add, respecting· his Lordship, that “the General did all that could be ex-

pected from a braue and experienced Officer.'’ Th
