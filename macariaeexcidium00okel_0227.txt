Of the general sentiments of the 111511 Roman Catholies towards the Protestant settlers
in lreland, on the accession of James 11. to the throne, Dr. King, afterwards Archbishop ot*
Dublin, asserts: ‘⁵ They affirmed, both publickly and privately, with many outliS, that they
would, in a short time, have our estates and churches ; that if they suffered us to live, they
would make us hewers ofwoocl and drawers osu-utem that Ireland must be a Catholick country
whatever it cost; and, as for the English, they would make them as poor devils, as when they
first came into Ireland.’'

Dr. John Mulony, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork, one of the most Μία-1111111111 leading
Irish politlcal characters of those times, thus expresses himself, as to the course which lte would
recommend, for the adoption ot' his eountrymen, towards their domestic adversaries. In a
letter from France, March 8111, 1689, to his brother 111-011119, Dr. Patrick Tyri-ell, Roman Ca-
tholic 31511ορ of Clogher and KHmore, and Secretary of State in Irelandv he says,—“ 1 would
have thens’ [the Irish Roman Catholics] “restored to their estates both spiritual and temporaL
usurped by the Cromwellimzs, or under the title of being Protescants, yet, with that proviso for
the spiritual, that a competent pension should be allowed to the Protestant possessor during his
life. for he can pretend no longer lease ot'it ; or that he should give the Catholick Bishop or
Incumbent a competent pension, isit were 11101191111111131[0101111111 enjoy his possession during
life.'‘ Then, turning from the consideration ofecclesiastical changes, to the difficulties existing
with regard to the resumption of their old properties, by the original Irish proprietors, 011
account of the purchases made.. in various instanceS, on Cromwellian titles, by several Irish
lawyers and others, Bishop Molony observes : “ Now remains, 1 think, one objection to solve,
which may give some obstruction to this intended settlement, which is, that ot* the gown-men
111 others, who made purchases of some new interests, hoadfitle: must they lose their purchase
and money? To which I answer, that although 1111111)Ἴ be reply'd‚ careat emptor, especially 111
the grown-men, who knew best ofall that. horrid Act of Settlement, or so called, was most unjust
and could by no true law hold; yet, because they are persons useful to the commonwealth,
and acted hnw'ifitle(seei11g the estate out. of the ancient proprietor's hands by so many publiek
Acts, as it was not like ever to come to him again), there ought an expedient to be found
for the like, that they be not losers, and that either they or the ancient proprietors may be
recompensed one way 01· other, rather than it should be an obstacle to the common good.''

From a comparison of all the printed evidence we possess on the conduct of James lI.
respecting ecclesiastica] matters in Ireland, with whatever is contained in the State Paper
Office, London, on the same subject, it is most 111-1111111111», that he intended the Roman Catholic
Church should be nn Estahlished, ifnot THE Established Church here* ; but, according to his

Memoirs
