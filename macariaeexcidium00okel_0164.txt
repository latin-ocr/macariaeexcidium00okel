Lysander on the left, and given their several] Posts to the Rest of the

he saw Occasion. Ororis being come up at so near a Distance, that
his Rams and other battering Engins might doe Execution‚ he ordered
them to be discharged, and haveing a vast Number of them, he made
them play incessantly uppon the Cypriam Army, hopeing by that
Meanes to force them from the Hill, which was of great Advantage.
But the Cypriam, encouraged by the Presenee and Conduct ofPleyrrus,
kept their Ground, and beat the Ciliciam, as often as they advanced to-
wards them. The Fight continued from Noon till Sunsett‚ the Cyprian
