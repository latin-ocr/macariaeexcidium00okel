twenty abrenst, all in armour, seconded by another strong detachment of Grenadiers (which
were to be supported by six battalions of foot) and with unparallelled resolution took the ford
a little to the left of the bridge in the face of a Bastion, the river being very rapid and deepQ
and the passage difficult by reason of some large stones. At the same time, the English from
their Batteries and Works played upon the Enemy, who flred as quick as possible upon those in
the river: but, by an inex-edible effort ofbravery‚ they forced their way through tire and smoak‚
and, having gained the opposite bank, laid planks over the broken part of the briclge, and
prepared their Pontoons; by which means the English made their passage so quick, that in
less than half an hour they were Masters of the town, and in possession of the NVorks, which
lay intire towards the Enemy's Camp; the Irish being so amazed at the suddenness of the
attack, and resolution of the assailants, that they abandoned the place, and fled to the army
though not without considerable loss.'⁷

Of the conduct of Brigadier‚ Major General, or Colonel Thomas Maxwell, to whose
supposed “ neglect or· treachery'' Colonel O'Kelly ascribes the circumstance of Athlone
having been surprised, the Duke of Berwick gives this very different account: “ Maxwell„
Marechal de Camp de jour, qui s'y trouvoit alors commandant ὲ son tour, eut beau avertit
Saint-Ruth des preparatifs qu'il voyoit faire, 81 deinander un renfort de troupes, n’ayant que
deum bataz'llons (le nouvelles tronpes (ear on y relevoit la garde comme dans une tranchee)‚ on
lui repondit que s'il avoit peur, on y envoyeroit un autre Officier Generalz les ennemis donc
se jetterent dans l'eau ἃ attaquerent la breche, que nos troupes abandonnerent σρνὶκς une
dicltarge. Maxwell y fit ferme avec quelques Officiers; mais la plupart ayant ete tu‘es a ses
cotes, il fut pris, ἃ alors les ennemis coulerent le long du rempart'¹⁰.

It should be noted here, that Maxwell was a partizan of Tyreonnell as opposed to St. Ruth,
and that what the Duke of Berwiek writes of this campaign of 1691, was evidently derived

from aTyrconnellite source. Colonels O‘Kelly and O’Neill, on the other hand, were the par-

tizans of St. Ruth against Tyrconnell.

b Of the actual depth of the river, as ascertained
some days before, by three Danes appointed for the
purpose, Captain Parker says: “ The deepest part
of the river took them up to the navel: but it had
not been known so low in tlte memory of any liv-
iny.'' The Williamite Lord Chaucellur and Lord
Justice for Ireland, Sir Charles Porter, in his un-
published letter, Dublin, June 29th, 1691, describ-
ing this trial of the depth of the river by the
three Danes, alleges: ‘⁴ thoy found it not above
knee deep in most places. Sc that 20 might march a
breast.'' With respect to the condition of the for-
tifications on the Irish side, in the direction where
the English attacked, Story states: “ The Ford

was a little to the left of the Bridge over against

a Bastion of the Enemies, where a Breach was
made already.'’ And King James, mentioning how
the English having “found a fordable place in the
river,'’ it “ encouraged them to a fresh attempt,''
adds, ‘⁴ have-ing already made such breaehes in the
wall by three batteries which playd cross the water,
that the river was become the sole desenceR'-( Au-
