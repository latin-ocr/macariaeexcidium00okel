The Irislz Roman Catholies ofEnglislz origin vigorously assist Queen Elizahetlz against their

The Lord Deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester, referring, in 1613, to the Elizabethean or Ty-
rone war, says of “ Tyrone and his Irish partakers in the late rebellior), when they thought
to carry the kingdom from the Crown of England,⁷’ that they declared, no persons whatever
of English origin, “though they came in with the conquest, and were since degenerffled, and
become Irish by alteration of name and customsss, should inherit or possess a foot ofland
within the kingdom, for that they had of the ancient Irish that could pretendjustly to every
foot ofland which they possessed, who should enjoy the same.”

On the other hand, O’Sullivan Beare treats such a representation of matters as an artifice
of the English, in order to keep the Anglo-Irish on their side. “ Finigaldae vel Anglicae
prouinciae, δι principibus Iber-nis noui generis‚” he observeS, ·‘ toto studio persuadere conati
sunt, illos fuisse possessionibus suis, atque finibus pellendos ab antiquis Ibernis, qui pro Ca—
tholica fide arma sumpserunt, si vincerent: qua fallacia faciles homines non modo sibi obedi-
entes, sed multos Catholicis infensos 1·eddiderunt'¹¹¹.

ε When Chichester represents the Irish speak-
ing of those of English origin who became Irish,

as having thereby deyenerated, he, of course, puts
an English notion on the matter into the mouths
of the Irish. They would not call that degenera-
ting: nox· did such as became Irish think they de-
yenerated.
