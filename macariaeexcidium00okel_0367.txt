oppose the Scotch “rebels‚” by whose Subsequent union with the disaffected English the
monarchy was overthrown, is stated by Dr. Curry to have amounted to ‘⁴ about {mmo men ;
&000 of which number were lrish Catholics.'¹ The Doctor cites the following testimony from
Carte, as to the character of that army. ¹⁶ Sir William St. Leger, Sel-jeant-Major-General of
the Army, having reviewed these troops at Carrickfergus, saw such willingness and aptness
in them to learn their exercises‚ and that mettle and gallant appearance, which would recom-
mend them to be chosen for a service where a crown lay at stake, made no scruple to pro-
nounce, that, considering how newly they had been raised, no Prince in the Christian world
had, for their number, a better and more ordei-ly body of nien in his service.¹'

In the “ Declaration of the Connuons assembled in Parliament, concerning the Rise and

land, by his Majesty, is mentioned in very different terms. “ The Popish Irish Ar1ny,'' observes
that document, “ was kept on Foot there for a long Time after the Beginning of this Parlia-

great Furtherance of this Rebellion, by teaching those barbarous Villains the Knowledge of
Arms under the Notion of fighting against Scotlaml, but now made Use of, to extirpate both
English and Scots from the Kingdom of Ireland·“. See Notes 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23.
