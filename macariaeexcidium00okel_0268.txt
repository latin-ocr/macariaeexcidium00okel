of training institution for missionaries to Heathen lancis, bnt likewise as a second Thebais for
oherishing the exercises of ascetic life, and ageneral school of the west, for the cultivation of
the study ot' philosophy, and of the Holy Scriptures : so that I can scat-ce tell whether it has
attained to greater glot-y, from having produced, aud sent forth into the world, Doctors and
Apostles, almost without number, or from the circumstance, that the countless instances of
the arrival. settlement, and sepulture, in our land. of ltalians. Gauls. Germans, Erimus,
Picts, Angues, or Saxons, and persons from other nations, who flocked here, desirous os the
henefits of strict discipline or improvement in learning, have been such, that the place might
well he called a general institute ofpolite literature for Europe, and a general retreat for the
frdlowers of the ascetic life.‘'

Lord Lyttelton remarks :—·‘ We learn from Bede, an Anglo-Saxon‚ that, about the middle
of the seventh century, numbers, both of the nobles and of the second rank of English, left
their country, and retired out of Englaud into Ireland, sor the salze of studying theology‚ or
leading there a stricter life. And all these (he affirms) the Iris-h, whom he calls Sem, most
willingly received. and maintained at their own charge, supplying them also with books, and
being their teachers without see ar reu-ard. A most honourable testimony, not only to the
learning, but likewise to the hospitality and bounty, of that nation. Great praise is liltewise
due to the piety of those Irish ecclesiasties. who (as we know from the clear and unquestion-
alde testimony of many foreign writers) made themselves the Apostles of barbarous Heathen
nafions, without any apparent inducement to such hazardous undertakings, except the merit
of the work. By the preaching of these men, the Northumbrians‚ the East Angles, and the
Nol-thern Picts‚ were converted. Convents also were founded hy them in Burgundy, Ger-
many, alid other foreign eountries, where they distinguished themselves by the rigid Integrity
and purity of their manners3 so that Ireland, from the opinion conceived ostheir sanctity, was
called the country ofsaints.”

Mr. O'Conor adds:—“ The (Irish) monks set up 50110015, in which they edueated the
youth, not. only of the island, but of the neighbouring nations. They sent their missionaries
in shoals into the Continent, converting its Heathen and confirming its Christian inhabitants:
set up schools in those parts, and laid the foundation of the most flourishing universities in
Europe. They taught the Saxons and Normans (i. e. Danes or Northmen) the use of letters,
and they converted the Cruthneans or Picts to Christianity by the preaching of Columb-Kille,
who quitted his right of succession to the throne of Ireland to reign over the hearts of a
foreign people, enemies to his own nation. When Europe groaned under the servitude of
Gothic ignorance, lreland became the prime seat of learning to all Christendom. Hither the
sciences, such as they were in those ages, fled for protection; and here their followers and
professors were amply supported. For the convertes] SaxonS, the nation erected, in the west,
the college of May0‚ to this day called Illayo osche Saxons ...... In the city ofArdmacha,
it is affirmed, that no fewer than 7000 scholars studied, at the same time, within its univer-

sity; although the kingdom, at that time, contained several other academies equally cele-
brated, if not equally numerous. On such foundations, did they cultivate Christianity‚ at
