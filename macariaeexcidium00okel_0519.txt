The Williamite historiam Harris, says of Sarsfield, in connexion with his preferring to
abandon his native country for France, rather than acknowledge King William sor his Sove-
reign : “ The Irish great Officers went on hoard with the last of their Forces on the 22d of
December, and with them Sarffleld embarked to seek a fortune in a strange Country, when he
might have remained an ornament to his ownss‘. But he was actuated by a strong bias to what,
in his opinion, was the true religion, and hy the false principles ofhonour and loyalty to a
Prince, who had made it the whole business of his Reign to overturn an established constitu-
tion''x.

In this statement, Colonel O’Kelly seems to allude to an omission in the fair or executed
copy of the Treaty, which, had it not been remedied‚ would have consigned numbers of his
eountrymen to forfeiture„ or ruin. The omission occurred in the second of the Civil Articles
of Limerick, in which, after the mention of ‘⁶ Lymerielz, Clare, Kerry, Cork, and Mayo,” the
words. ‘⁴ and all suc-ll as are under tl1.ez'r''—i. e. the Irish—“ Protectz'on iu tlte said Comztz'es‚'’
were left out. These words having been agreed to, and inserted accordingly in the rough
draft as a portion of the Treaty, were, as is said, through a clerical error, not inserted in the
copy engrossed for execution. This omission being detected by the Irish, aster the signing
of the document, they, upon the arrival from France of the Comte de Chiateau-Renaud, with
his fleet of eighteen men of war, four tire-ships, and twenty great vessels of burthen, con-
veying *200 officers, 3‚000 soldiers, and between e‚000 and ]0‚000 stand of arms for the relies
of Limeriek, insisted on having the original passage restored, before they would agree to
proceed any further, with the execution of the Treaty.

Story, having noted, how ‘⁴ all that the Frenclz and Iris-h Officers insisted on after the eom-
ing of their Fleet, was only to have a Clausa confirmed that was casually omitted in the Arti-
cles which the General promised them, and Their Majesties were pleased afterwards to Con-
descend to,·’ thus relates the remainder of the circumstances referred to: ‘⁴ It being late at
Night when the Artieles were agreed to, and they engrossed in Haste, this Clause, And all
suclz as are under their Protectiun in the said Cozcnties, was omitted by the Engrosser, tho‘ z‘t
was certainly inserted in tlzefuul Dranglzt. This was what the [rislz Officers desired might
