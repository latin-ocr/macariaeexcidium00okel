The Irislz adher-e to J ames II .‚ though lle was suspected by them, of being no better disposed,
tham lzz's brother, (Νεανίας Il.‚ lo restore them their estates.

This motion, as to the disinclination of James to do justice to the Roman Catholics of
lreland, by reinstating them in those lands which had been vested in the Cromwellians by
the Acts of Settlement and Explanation (and for which opinion, indeed, some ground would
appear to have existed from the grant of Irish lands, received by James himself, as Duke of
Y‹11·l{‚ after the Restoratior1)¹'‚ is not, however, correct. That the King tras of himself in-
clinesl to make such a restoration, notwithstanding the strong obstacles existing in England
to the passing of any such Act in favour of the ejected Irish, is apparent from the following
passage of the French Ambassador's despateh to Louis XIV. W'riting from England to his
master, October 16, 1687, Barillon says :-“ Milord Sonderland m'a dit que le Roy son
maine est resolu de renverser retablissement fait des biens des Irlandois Catholiques aux
Anglois Protestans apres le retour du Roy d'AngleterreQ que cela est encore tenu fort
secret ; mais qu’on y travaillera bientot, et que les mesures sont prises pour en venir a bout.
Le renversement de cette {tablissement fait en faveur des rebelles, et des officiers de Crom-
wel⁴ est regarde icy comme ee qu'il y a de plus important; et s'il peut etre execute sans opposi—
tion, ce sera une entiere separation de l'Irlande d'avec l’Angleterre pour l'avenir. C'est le sen-
timent general de tous les Anglois.''

That Barillon was right in the description he here gives, of the general feeling in England
against a repeal of the Acts of Settlement and Explanation‚ or, in other words, that the Eng-
lish, whether Roman Catholics or Protestants, were equally unwilling to have the Irish Roman
Catholics restored to their estates, is also evident from the letter (previously cited in these
notes) of Dr. John Molony, Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork, to Dr. Patrick Tyrrell, Roman
Catholic Bishop of Clogher and Kihnore. Dr. Molony, writing to Dr. Tyrrell from France
(when James ΙΙ. was on his way from Paris to embark for Ireland), and, endeavouring in his
letter to impress upon his brother prelate‚ that the time was then at hand sor the Irish to
redress their own wrongs, by taking immediate measures to recover their properties froin
the Cromwellians, instead of consenting to postpone that recovery, according to the advice
of James's English adherents, until after the restoration of the King to his throne in Eng-
land, says :-.“ For never a Catholiclz, or other English, will ever think or make a step, nor
suffer the King to make a step for your restoration, but leave you as you were hitherto. and
leave your enemies over your heads to erush you any time they please‚ and cut you off root
and branch, as they now publicly declare: and blame themselves they have not taken away
your lives along with your estates long agos3 nor is there any Englishman, Catholz‘ck or other,
