battle from King James and the Irish army on the :21st of September, affirms the veteran
GeneraL used to say, “ That it was not in their Power to make him fight but when he pleased.''
And, as regards an attempt of either army to force the other to an engagement, ‘⁴ there being
several Bogs and Causeys between us and them‚’' remarks that writer, ‘⁴ whosoever gave the
Attacque (all things else considered) it was Odds against them.”

These representatIOns of the Williamite Chaplain are supported by what the veteran Mar-
shal himself states, in his letter of the ⁵27th of September, 1689, from the camp at Dundalk,
to his master, William ΙΙΙ. Having premised„ ⁴‘ Ce que je puis juger de l·‹‘·tat de l'ennemie,
est que le Roi Jacques ayant ramasse enee rnyaume tout ce qu'il a pn, vaudroit bien en venir

nous allons entrer,'' the marshal adds ; “ Le meme raison qui empeche les ennemys de pou-

conclus-ion of the campaign.

King James, writing from his quartem, at the end of September, to Lord Waldgrave in
Paris, concerning the various efforts made to bring Schonberg to a battle, says: ‘⁸ Having
gathered together as good an army as ever was seen here, and as well provided as possible,
finding in both officers and soldiers a resolution for God, ourselves, and their country, and an
eal-nest desire to be brought to the cnemy3 on the fith of September, we came with them
within three miles of Dundalk, where Schomberg lies encamped. Since which time we have
often offered him occasions os battle. We have omltted nothing that might provoke him to
it by excursions of parties to his out guards, hy foraging near his camp, and ccnsuming with
tire what we could not transport; yet,” adds the King, “he continues within his trenches.
without accepting a battle, or even a fair skirmish, although his parties have been often much
superior in number to ours.'' The circumstances connected with Marshal Schonberg's posi-
tion, that secured him from being compelled to fight against his will, have been given.

ln the same cold and rainy season, which destroyed so many of the Marshal's army in
their eneampment‚ and the effects of which must have been so unfavourable to the men and
horses of any force attempting to keep the field to a very late period, James did not send all his

army
