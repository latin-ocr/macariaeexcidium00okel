illemoz‘r of Colonel Clmrles O‘Kelly. xiii

John O'Kelly tlzeyozmq, in contradistinction to his elder brother, Charles. When
the Revolution took place 111 England and Scotland the following year, the cause
of King James was supported by Colonel Chai-les O'Kelly and his family, in the
same manner, that he and his father had formerly adhered to the cause of His
Majcsty's father and brother, Kings Charles I. and Charles II. In the Parlia—
ment summoned in Dublin in 1689, by King JamOS, after his flight from Eng-
land to Franco, and landing in Ireland, Coloncl Charles O'Kelly sat as Member
for the County, and his brother, John, as Melnber sor the Borough, of Roscom-
mon. The Coloncl was commissioned, in the summer of the same year, to
levy a regiment of infantry for the King's service, to be commanded by himself,
with his brother John, as his Lieutenant—Colone13 and the Colonel's only son,
Denis, joined the cavalry of the Irish army, 111 1110 regiment of Pierce Butler,
Lord Galinoy³. The infantry regiment ofColonel O'Kelly, however, was not long
kept up, though we find him serving 1110 King with the rank of Coloncl, and
his brother, John, with that of Licutenant-Colonel. Lord Mountcashel's force,
sent against the Enniskilliners, being routed at Newton-Butler, July 31st; the
blockade of Derry being likewise raised by the royal arniy; and SligO, in con-
sequence of a false rumour, and the panio connected with these 1ον01505, being
not long after abandoned; 1110 Enniskilliners scizcd that place by a detachment
under Lieutenant-Colonel Gor-2, and made it their frontier post, for hostilities
against the King's adherents in Connaught. Colonel O'Kelly‚ from 1115 age, (hc
was then sixty-eight), and his former services in Ireland and on the Continent,
was reckoned the best officcr for undertaking the defence of that province, and
directed by Brigadier Patrick Sarsfield to oppose the enemy there, with such a
force of the country militia as could be collected, the King then requiring the
national army, under himself, to be as strong as possible, in order to stop the march
of Marshal Schonberg, 110111 1110 North, towards Dublin. The Colone] accordingly
advanced towards Boyle ς which, for some time, rendered the enemy rather appre-
hensive of being attacked in SligO, than desirous of acting offensively towards
the South. On September 19th, however, the famous Enniskillen Colonel,
Thomas Lloyd, marched from Sligo, over the Curlew mountains, with a select
party of cavalry and infantry, and, next morning, about sunrise, falling, in a
fog,
³ Erroneously called, elsewhere, the regiment of having been only one of root, and Lord Galmoy's
Lord Galway ,· that young nobleman’s regiment one of horse.
