In reference to the domestic “ obstacles'' resulting from the disaffeetion of Colonel Henry
Luttrellf, δια, with which the Duke had to contend, the Memoirs allege: “ all these obstacles
hinder'd not the Lord Lieftenant (tho he was now very infirme, and naturally slow in his
motions as well as his resolutions) to doe all that was possible to put the Town in a condition
of desence: he assembled the troops and formed a Camp under the Canon ofthe place, encom-

passing it bya line, and sent out parties to fetch in beef, &c.‚ and made the Officers and Soldiers
(first shewing the example himself) to take an Oath of fidelity which contain'd a resolution to
defend his Majestys right to the last, and never to surrender without his consent; but not-
withstanding this Oath and engagement, many Officers soon began to moue for a treaty, alledg-
ing that in all probability the affair would be determined one way or the other before the
King's mind could be known but he press'd them only to haue patience twenty days, there
being no likelyhood of their being forced so soon, and that in so much time an answer might
be had from the King ; but while he was thus struggleing with the calamitous circomstances
of his Country, he was seized with the fit of an Apoplexy upon St Lawrence's dayz soon after
he had done his devotioris, and ths) he came to his senees and speech again, yet he only lan—
guished two or three days¹¹ and then dy'd‚ just when he was upon the point of procureing an
unity at least amongst themselves, the want of which was the greatest of the many evils they
labour’d under’‘⁵.

In two unpublished letters to Lord Merion from King James's Irish Attorney-General,
Secretary of State and War, and subsequent Lord Justice, for Ireland, Sir Richard Naglej,

dated Limerick‚ August 14th‚ 1691, the circumstances under which the Duke of Tyrconnell
died,

f Is it not odd, that Colonel O‘Kelly says nothing
about the arrest and trial of Luttrell, for the im-

, proper correspondence, which he was discovered,

by his friend, Lord Lucan, to have been carrying
on with the enemy? See Notes 163, 169, 185, 254.

Β That is, the tenth of August, or a day earlier
than Colonel O'Kelly says.

¹¹ It would have been more correct to have
written ‘⁶ three or four days,'' since, from Sir
Richard Nagle's letter, (fortunately preserved in
Clarke's Correspondence l) we find, that the Duke
ut' Tyrconnell died on thesourtlz day after St. Lau-
rence's day, or that on which he is mentioned to

have been struck with apoplexy.

j If we had Sir Richard Nagle's papers as ,Ιιιυυ-
bite Secretary of War, (as well as those ot* the ll'il-
Iiamz'te Secretary of Wa1·,) how much mort¹ would
be our knowledge on the subject connected with
such papers, than it ever can be without them. The
writer of this note has grounds for supposing, that
a considerable portion of such Jacobite military
papers may be extant, and that he might find them,
were he permitted to search for them by Govm-n-
ment.
