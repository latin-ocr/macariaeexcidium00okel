the arivall of the old heir of the familly of Tyrconnel, Odonald, of whom they pretend a
prophecy, that he is to obtain a victory of the English near Limmerick. So far the people
ar led by this fancy, that the very Fryars‚ & some of the Bishops, have taken arms to follow
him; but Iam affray'd, that they will forgett all, when danger, draws neer.’'

Story, in connexion with the military transactions of the leth of August, 1690, at the
first siege, or successful defence, of Limerick, against William 111„ speaks as follows of
O'DonnelL and the Irish predictions connected with his presence there z “ About this Time,
we had an Account of one Balderocle Rlzo ODouneL of the ancient Family of Tyreonnel:
this Man was born and educated in Spain. But there being a Prophecy amongst the Irish,
that he should free his Country from the English, doing great Matters in his own Persou,
and more by his Conduct, he was sent for on Purpose, and came to Limericlc. lt's incredible
how fast the vulgar Irish flocked to him at his first Coming; so that he had got in a small
Time 7 or &000 Rapporees, and such like People together, and began to make a Figure;
but after a while the Business cool·d‚ and they were weary of one another: and he is only
now a Colone] in Limeriek. They had another Prophecy also, That he should come to the
Field above Cromwell's Fort¹ where stands an old Church, where 011 a Stone hard by we.
should pitch our utmost Colours, and afterwards be undone, with a thousand such like Fop-
peries, not worth the Naming.'' Nevertheless, Story elsewhere admits, in alluding to Irish
predictions: “I have heard also Some of the Irish tell us before we got thither, that we
should not succeed at the first Siege of Limerick,· and they had no other Reason for it, but
because one of their Prophesies said so.'* O‘Donnell is likewise noticed in thc Lumlon Gu-
:ette, as ‘⁴ that Baldarick ODonnel, whose Natne has been made great Use of among those
of the Irish, who build much upon Prophecies.'¹

ΜΓ. Croker, in noting how “a prophecy was generally current in Ireland, that an O'Don-
nell, with a red mark, should free his country from the dominion of England‚” adds, “hence
his soubriquet of Baldearg—‘ Ball, a stain, spot, 01· 590011, either natural or artifici-'ih' and
Dearg. crimson.' '’ But this soubriquet is related to have been borne in Ireland above 1200
years before the W'ar of the Revolution; as O'Flaherty‚ noticing a miracle, alleged to have
been connected, in St. Patrick's time, with the birth, to the first Christian King of Thomond,
of a son. called Achaius Balldearg, thus gives the derivation of the Irish sirname by which
O'Donnell was known in the seventeenffi, as Achaius was in the fifth, century. “ Puer tum
natus Achaius Balldearg vocatus est, i. e. vestigii rubei, vel artus rubei. Ball enirn Hibernis
idem est aliquando quod artus vel membrum, aliquando quod vestigium: ἃ Dearg idem
quod rubeum. Mansit enim in ejus carne, in testimonium miraculi, quoddam rubeum ves-
tigium¹¹''.
