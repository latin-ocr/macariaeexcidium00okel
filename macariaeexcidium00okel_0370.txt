Of the political rivalship existing between the Duke of Tyrconnell and Lord Mountcashel,
to which the Duke's causing his Lordship to be appointed to the command of the Irish troops
going to France is attributed, King James, in mentioning the opposition shown by his Lord-
ship to the interest of the ane in France, the following year, 1691, says: ‘⁴ My Lord Mont-
cassel who had a great and beneficia] command over those Irish who came first into France
(where he now was settled) had always been of an opposite partie to My Lord Tyrconnel,
and did all he could to thwart whatever he aimed at in that Courtg which,'' adds his Majesty
of himself, “ still made the King's taske the more difficult, where there were so many different
intersts and concurrent factions to be managed, both of the French and his own subjects‚ and
yet a due regard to be had to them all.''

On the assistance (if it can be called so) from France, which arrived in Ireland in March,
1690, under Lauzun, and, in return for which, Lord Mounteashel was sent with a body of the
best Irish troops to France, the Duke of Berwiek, after mentioning the recall of Count
ffAvanx, observes: “ A la priere de la Reine d’Angleterre, le Roi Tres-Chretien envoya i:
sa place le Duc (le Lausun, ἐ qui il donna aussi le commandement des sept bataillons Fran-
qois qu'il avoit rfzsolu de faire passer 011 Irlande. Le Roi avoit demande au Roi Tres-
Chretien un secours de troupes, ἐ cause que le Prince d'Orangc se preparoit ῖι y venir en
personne, avec une armee considerablffl mais ce petit nombre n‘fitoit pas srqffisanl, &fut cause

emmenees le Duc de Lausun''³. See Note 103, pp. 317-318.

King James, in referring to this French aid as only “about 6000 men and some few cloaths
for the Soldiers‚‘’ (namely‚ the Irish soldiery), thus complains of the conduct of the French
minister, Louvois ε “ That great and powersull Minister did not concur in giveing such assis-
