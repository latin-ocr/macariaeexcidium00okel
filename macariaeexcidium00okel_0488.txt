que presque tous les Officiers Generanx y ont perdu ou la liberte, ou la vie.'’ The reasons of
this obstinate resistance on the part of the Irish officers appear in an unpublished letter to
General Ginkell, from George Peyton, Esq.‚ Williamite High Sheriff of the County West-
meath, June 10111, 1691, 01· only about a month previous to the battle, as stated to him by
two Irish Captains, his acquaintances, who were made prisoners at Ballymore. “ They say,”
he observes, ‘⁴ it is our fault we have so many enemies3 and that they are sensible of their un-
happiness in depending on the French; that they must, and will, and are preparing to fight
it out soon; that they have orders to have none but fighting men.'' &a

King James's estimate of the loss of his own and the opposite army at Aughrim is, that
⁴· the Irish lost near 4000 men, nor was that of the English much inferior.'' The Williamite
Captain Parker says of the Irish, “the enemy had near 4000 killed.'' But, perhaps, the near-
est approach to accuracy, at which we can arrive on this point, has been supplied hy the
testimony of a Huguenot Captain, as thus cited by a contemporary biographer of William:
“ ΖΗΓ. Du-Teny, (ι Captm'n in oue qftlte French Regiments, and α Person nfgreat Integrity,
hus assur-'tl me, chat tlze Day after the Figlzt, he counted 4838. dead Boclies upon the Field of
Battle, ofwlziclt he supposes near 4000 lo have been Irish ; besides those that were killed in the
Pars-uit beyond their Camp.⁷‘ From these 4638 bodies, deducting Ginkell‘s adsm'lled proportion
of 673 for men and officers slain, the 1rish‚killed on the field, would be 3965. And, from the late
hour at which the battle turned against the Irish—the time it mus-t have taken, to kill all who
still fought on, 01· were denied quai-ter on the fiech-the foggy rain, as well as the night, which
,set in,—the great bogs so convenient for the shelter of a broken infantry against cavalry,—
with other circumstances that might be mentioned—it seems difficult to conceive, how any
very considerable number, in addition to those who fell on the field, could have been slainb,

A very large proportion ofthe Irish loss is related to have taken place under the follow-
ing circumstances, mentioned, on the Williamite side, in Story, Major Tempest's letter, and
the previously cited Dutch account 111 French, and, on the Jacobite side, hy Dr. Charles Les-
lie. “ The 1rish,” says Story, “upon their Advantage in the Centre of the Battle, had taken
some Prisoners (as has been said); but not being able to carry them off, they killed Col.
Herberl‚ and one or two more 3 which several have lookt upon as a Piece of Cruelty : and yet
it‘s no more than what has been practised in such Cases 3 for at the Battle of Agincozcrt, Fought
between Heu. 5tl1. of England, and Clmrles 1119 61Ιι. of France, upon the 24111. of octob.
1414. the Number ofthe Prisoners, taken by the English, being very great, and King IIenry,
after the Battle, perceiving fresh Troops of the King osz‘ez‘lls [Sicily] to appear in the Field‚
and these strong enough without any new rallyed Forces to Encounter his wearied Soldiers ;
that he might not therefore have both Prisoners to Guard, and an Enemy to fight at once, he
commanded every Man to kill his Prisoner, contrary to his Generous Nature3 which was
immediately done, some principa] Men excepted.'' F
