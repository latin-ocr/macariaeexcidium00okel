brated defeat, in Spain, of Marshal Marmont, Duke of Ragusa, by the Duke of Wellingtom
at the battle of Salamanca, or the Arapilcs& in 18121.

NoTE 241, Pages 133—134.

This was the issue of that famous battle at Auglzrim, so glorians to Gz'nkell, und so fatal to
St. Ruth and the Irish, who lost there tlzeflower of their army and nation.

The loss of General Ginkell's army at the battle of Aughrim, as tabularly arranged from
the published official account, was as follows z

Killed. Wounded. Killed ἃς Wounded.
Officers, . . . . 73 ..... 111 ..... 184
Soldiers, . . . . 600 ..... 906 ..... 1506
ΤοΤΑι, . 673 ..... 1017 ..... 1690

Captain Parker, however, alleges of what his own or the Williamite side suffered on that
‹la)*‚.-“ We had above 3000 killed and woundeffly.

The principal officere, mentioned as killed in Ginkell's army, were Major General Hol-
staple (as spelled by Story, bnt, more probably, Holtzapfel), who commanded the Earl of
Portland's Horse Guards, Colonel Charles Herbert‚ the Danish Colonel Mongatts, and Majors
Devenish, Cornwall, Colt, and Fox. The principal officers, specified as wounded, were Bri-
gadier Prince George of Hesse Darmstadt, Colonel Lord George Hamilton, Colonel Lord
John Cutts, Colonel Thomas Erle, the French or Hnguenot Colonel Belcastel, and Lieute-
nant-Colonel Brudenell.

The importance attached, at the time ofits occurrence, to the battle of Aughrim‚ not only
in an Irish, but a British and Continental point of view, and the proportionate fame acquired
by General Ginkell for gaining it, are attested by the following, amongst other evidence that

might be adduced.

'⁶' ‘⁴ Les Allies‚'' says the Spanish historian,
Count 'rori—no, ‘⁵ donnerent ὲ cette bataille le nom
de Salamanque, parce qu'elle se livra dans les en-
virons de cette ville, et les Francais des Arapiles,
..... monticules fameux dans les ehansons popu-
laires de ce pays, et qui rappellent les glorieuses
aventures de Bernard del Carpi0.³’ See Note 231.

Υ Which of those two Williamite statements of
the Wiuiamite loss at Aughrim is most entitled to
our belief? Are the p1·op0rti0n5‚ in the first ac-
count, of wouuded to killed, such as they should
be? If Captain Parker considered that account
correct, why did he not adopt it, instead of such a
different estimatc of his own 2? Compare, on those
points, the conflicting Williamite statements, given
in Note 159, p. 377, respecting *Villiam's loss at
Limerick, aud the aunexed references to other
Notes.
