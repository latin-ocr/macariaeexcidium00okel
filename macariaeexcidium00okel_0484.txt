haue dixpersed those few squaclruns of tlte Enemie, who as yet were but a formeing, when by a
cannon shot he was unfortunately kill‘d, just as he was saying to those about him, They are
beaten, Zet us heac them to the purpose.- this accident caused a great confusion, and tho en-
deavours were made to conceal his death, yet the first Squadron of the life guard, who was
next him, stoping upon it, the rest did the same and occasion'd a great delay, which the enemie
tooke care to profit by, and passing in the intrim a considerable body of hors through the
demes, attack'd and broke both the lines of the Irish foot, the hors not advanceing in time to
their assistance: but insteed of that, giveing all for lost, thought of nothing but saveing them-
selues, aud so gaue an entire victory to the English”‘. This is accounted for in next Note.

'l'he Irislz cavalry, diseouraged at St. Rums death, aad none of tlze Gener-al Officers coming
to head them al that place, gave back, and quitted tlzefield.

Besides those cavalry, that the French General is mentioned, in the royal Memoirs, to have
brought with him, for the intended charge, before which he was killed, we are told by Captain
Parker, that ‘⁴ St. Ruth also had posted Lieutenant General Sarsfield with a reserve body of
Horse in the rear oftheir (the Irish) center, with positive directions not to slirfmm thence,
until lte received Itis orders.’' Then, after having mentioned the advance of St. Ruth to his left
wing at Aughrim, to set matters to rights there, and his death, the Captain states : ‘⁴ Sarsfield
was very punctual in observing St. thllc's orders; for though he had several opportunities of
doing great service, yet he would not stir from his post, still ezpecting his General's orders.
At length he saw all was lost, and was then obliged to scamper off with the crowd, without
striking one stroke, though he had the greatest and best part ostheir Cavalry with him?

A disagreement between Sarsfield and St. Ruth, at and for some time previous to the battle,
—and which may, under such circumstanceS‚ have rendered it the more imperative on Sars-
field to observe that striet obedience to orders which would prevent his venturz'ng to do any-
thing on his own responsibility, until it was too late-is affirmed to have contributed to the
loss of the day by the Irish.

Harris, who mentions that quarrel to have been connected with the surprise of Athlone,
and to have been, as regards the battle of Aughrim, ¹‘ of fatal consequence to their cause,''
after observing of St. Ruth's death, “ His fall dismayed his troops, and many of them drew
off with his guards, who removed his body,'’ adds, “Sarsfiech who should have commanded
them, (and who, since the dispute at Athlone, was on the reserve with St. Rutlt) not knowing
the order of battle.'⁷
