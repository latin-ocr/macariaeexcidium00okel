Excidz'um M accirioe ; or,

that race themselves, that, with heart and arms, they entered bitterly into
the conflict against the Galamidoe.

30. The leader, however, of the auxiliary eohorts sent by the King
of Egsgtpt, had much damped the ardour of the Cypriam troops, having,
whether from cowardice or treachery, surrendered to the Ciliciam the
forti-esses and cities which he held3 and the inhabitants, no longer able
to maintain the war, had to come to ternis. The Chieftains of Lapatia,
who knew, by sad experience, how frail was the relianee on Ciliciam saith,
felt they had no hope left, and fied to Delphos, and Eleusina at once
seized on their estates, and distributed them amongst the ehiefs and
privates of her Martanesian soldiery; and it was determined to plant
them with adventurers from Cilicia and Pamphilae, and thus gradually
extirpate the ancient creed and ancient population. Although, in former
times, the murderous Martanesz'ans had driven Queen Diana from her
paternal throne of Pamphilia, and, when flying into Cilicia to her re-
lative, Eleusina, where she reckoned on a sase asylum, she had been,

concessit: tum insulani, protrahendo impares bello, cuni hoste pacisci eo-
guntur. Lapiclzz‘oe vero Principes multis jam olim experimentis edocti, quam
fluxa esset Cilicum fides, desperatis domi rebus, Delphos se receperunt. Nec
mora Exulum bona agrosque Fisco jam adjudicatos, Eleusina ssIa7·ta⁷zesz'0s inter
Duees militesque divisit: Consilium euim erat, deductis in Insulam Cilicibus
Pamphiliisque coloniis, tum vetum Sacrorum morem tum Indigenas ad unum
omnes paulatim extirpare. Et quanquam superioribus anuis Reginam Dianam
patrio exturbatam solio Pamphilice finibus perduelles Martanesiz' exegissent,
eamque post in Ciliciam ad cognatam Eleusinam, tanquam ad tutissimum Asy
lum confugiens, contra gentium jura in teterrimum detrusa carcerem, ac post
diuturnum squalorem (o inauditam inhumanitateml) crudelissima nece pe-
rempta. est. Filius ejus Amasis, Eleusina fato functa Cilicum nihilominus
