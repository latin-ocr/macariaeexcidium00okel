What ‘⁴ privileges'' the. Irish Roman Catholic lawyers, concerned in the drawing up of the
Treaty of Limerick, conceived, that they were securing· for themselves and their countrymen
of that religion, in specifying such “ p1·ivileges‚'' as those ‘⁴ they did enjoy in the reign of King
Charles the II.’' and in likewise providing, that the previously—cited Oath of Allegianee, ‘⁴ and
no other‚'’ should be administered to them after theirsulnnission, may bejndged os, by the speech
of one of those lawyers, Sir Theobald Butler, when he appeared at the bar ofthe Anglo-Irish
House of Commons, together with two other eminent Roman Catholic barristers, Sir Stephen
Rice and Counsellor Malone, on Tuesday, February QQnd, 1703, to protest against the pass-
ing of a bill, entitled, “An Act to Prevent the further Growth of Popery‚'' as subversive of
the rights secured to themselves, and their Roman Catholie eountrynien, hythe Treaty of Lime-
rick. In mentioning the religion of himself and the great mass of his countrymen, as ⁸· that

The penal enactments against the Irish Roman Catholic Prelacy, &c., which, according
to Colonel UKelly’s views, would seem as if passed from a want of due provisions for the
religious liberty of his countrynien in the Treaty of Limerick, are well known, and will be

found at length in the Acts of Parliament, 7 ἃ 9 William 111. sess. I. e. 26. O

ἱ “ By the Treaty of Limericl<,” observes Mr.
Fame-ll, afterwards Sir Henry Parnell, and, finally,
Lord Conglomn, respecting the Irish Roman Ca-
tholics, “they were protected from being called
upon to take any other omlis, besides the Oath of
Allegiance of the lst william and Mary. By the
Penal Laws, they are required to take the Oaths
ot* Abjuration and Sup1·einacy‚ and to subscribe
declarations against the principal tenets of their
