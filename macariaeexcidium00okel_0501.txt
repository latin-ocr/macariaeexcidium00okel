to submit to the same side. For, after giving an account of thejunction of O'Donnell and
his forces with those of Lord Granard, in their advance by ‘⁶ Ahby Boyle‚'' September Uth,
against Slign, ‘⁴ On their Way,” says Story, ¹⁴ they summon'd Louglzlz'n, commanded by Colo>
nel leeobald Dillon; and another Plaee, commanded by Colonel Cltarles Κεῖῳ, both strong
Castles, and garison'd by the Irislzswhich surrendred ;¹’ ἃς.

The period about which O'Donnell completed his arrangements with Ginkell's agent, Co-
lonel James Richards, for going over to the Willhzmites, appears from the Colonel's above
mentioned letter of August l9th, 1691, to Colonel John Michelburne‚ in which he observes:
‘⁴ My Lord ODomzel, and Ι, have now regulated all Mamers, and will, to the utmost of his
Power, do what shall most contribute to Their Majesties Service :'' διο. By a valuable official
MS., which was in the Duke of Buckingham's library at stowe, ‘⁴ was the property of Alger-
non capel, Earl of Essex, in 17017and bears his anns on the outside cover,'' says Dr. Char-les
O’Conor, we find, “that to Colonel O'Donnel and to Colonel Henry Luttrell, who capi-
tulated to General Ginkle, yearly pensions of ‚f500 each are allowed from Christmas. mvl,
during their lives.'’ And, in another official MS. volume, belonging to J. T. Gilhert, Esq.,
Secretary of the Celtic Society, this annuity to O'Donnell. under the head of “ Military Pen-
sions, 1702,” is thus entered, “ To Col. o Donnell, pursuant to the Capz'itulss between Liente-
nant General Genkle, now Earl of Annene, and him—qe* diem AEl ,‚ 7 ,, 4ῗ--ῌ ann. εἕξ)[](ι”·’.

Respecting this conduct of O'Donnell— of whom, as has been seen, Story remarked at une
time, “ it’s incredible how fast the vulgar Irislz flocked to him‚'' and Lord Melfort noted, that
“ the very Fryars, ἃ some of the Bishops, had taken arms to follow him,”-King James, allud-
ing to his “ hidden practices,'' through which ·‘ there was a design of puting the Kingdoni into
the hands of the antient lrish, upon an equal foot with England,'' says, “this it was made
ODonnel so popular, and had raised him that mighty crowd of followers with which he liued
in a manner at discretiori while the war lasted ;'' and finally acted as has been related.

The conclusion of O'Donnell's career in this manner, after such anticipations as were en-
tertained of the wonderful things he was to accomplish,and the consequent popularity he had
acquired among the vulgar, was not unlike the end of another individual, noticed several centu-
ries before, in our history. Under the year 1215, according to the learned editor of the Annals
of the Four Masters. “the Annals of Ulster and of Kilronan mention the appearance afa
certain character, called Aeclh Breige, or the false or pretended Hugh, who was styled the
C0I1lzc17·t‹zel1,'' i. e. ‘⁴ the Aider. Lz'berator, or Deliverer. He,'' it is added, “ was evidently some
person, who wished to make it appear, that he came to fulfil some Irish prophecy, but failed
to make the intended impression''⁰. See Note 224.
