than as a medium for censuring Major Genera] Sheldon, in a manner not justified by other
accounts. Having promised how the English with their artillery “ ruined abundance of houses,
Churches, and at last open‘d a breach near St.Do1ninick·s Abbey, so large, that they made
shew of come-ing to un assault, but finding the garison too well prepared to receiue then1,'⁴
were “too well informed to hazard so desperate an atte1npt‚'' the royal Memoirs add, how
Ginkell was “ upon the point of quiting the enterprize, when by Clifford's neglect, not to say
wors, the Enemie made a bridg of boats and passed their hors and dragoons over the Shannors
near Annoghbeg‘ss and so cut between the Irish hors and the Town ; the danger of this have-
ing been foreseen, was the occasion of Clifford's being posted with 1500 Dragoons to oppose any
such attempt, haveing the hors Camp (commanded by Major General Sheldon) within two
miles of him, and the town within three; but instead ofgiveing either opposition, or so much
ηε notice ofwlzat was a (ἰθείης, snff‘er'd tlze Enemie to make their bridg under his ηυδε, so that
the first news which Maj: Gen: Sheldon had ofit‚ was that they were actually passed, and
Clifford retireing towards him : all therefore he could doe upon such a surprize, was by ad-
vanceing the Picket to stop the Enemie at a pass, till he could gain the mountains with his hors,
Dragoons, and some foot, and so make their way to six mile bridg, which with great diffi-
culty was performed at last; but not being able to subsist there, were order'd back towards

The Earl of VVest-Meath‚ in his letter from Clounine, August Qud, 1749, to William III.’s
biographer, Harris, gives this description of the misconduct of Brigadier clifford, and of
Major General Sheldon's conduct in connexion with it; a description substantiating, as will
be seen, the previous account of those transactions cited from King James's Memoirs: ‘⁶ Bri-
gadier Clfford‚'' says his Lordship‚ ⁸* commanded where the bridge was laid over, and, by α
verygreat neglect, he made no opposition to it. He was for that neglect confined in the Castle1,
and, Ibelieve, if the Articles were not made, he must ⁰f course be condemned by (ι Court Mar-
tial. Ι had a Regiment of Herse, and we were encainped on a Mountain within 3 miles of the
hridge, and the body consisted of about 3000 horse, commanded by General Sheldmz; and on
his having an account of Ginclcle's having laid a bridge over the Slzannon, and that a great
number both of Horse and Foot had passed it, he marc-hed with tho Horse to Sit-mile-hridge,
which we passed, and marched the next day to Clare, where we remained till we made arti-
cles. All that 1 write Ι assure you is true,” adds his Lordship, “and shall not be uneasy,
for that reason, that you make use of my name’'1'.
