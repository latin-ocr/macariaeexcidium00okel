Immediately on gainz'rzg the place, the English ‘nzanned the wall which covered the Connauglzt
,eide oftlze town, and, raz‘sz'ng tlze draw-bridge, preuented all relies enter-ing tlte place from
tlte Irislz Camp.

Captain Parker, after observing‚ “we were masters of the town before Sc. Ruth knew
anything of the matter‚’¹ says: ‘⁴ As soon as he heard it, he marched down in great haste to
*lrive us back a-gain5 but here he found, when it was too late, that be had been guilty of a
great mistake, in leaving the works on the back part of the town standing, and in good repair ;
for these were now α defeneefor as against himself} and indeed this was the only thing that
induced our Generals to attempt passing the river; for had he destroyed these works, we
should never Izave been able to defend the tou-n against liis wlzole army, especially as the castle,
which still held out, was crowded with mem for though we had battered down that face of it
which lay to the water, yet the other parts remained intire, and had a number of men in
them.” See, also, Note 217.

The Duke of Berwick informs us, that, when the English assaulted the place, ‘¹ saint-Ruth
entendant l'attaque, ἃ craignant quelque malheur, y envoya le Major GeneraL Jean Hamil-
ton, avec deux brigades d'infanterie3 mais il etoit trop tard, car z'l trouva Ze rempart bord?
cles troupes ermemies, & ainsi il fut oblige (le retourner au camp''¹¹.

Alaoewell asserted to have refused ballets, wlzen called for by tlte Iris-h soldiery in tlze town, asking

lo Ιιαυε ordered the men to take tlzeir rest, as there would he no action till night, so that

most os them were asleep, and few or none at meir posts, when tlze enemy entered the
town.

Colonel Felix O'Neill‚ who, in speaking of the defenoe of Athlone‚ gives it as his opinion,
that ‘⁶ no place was ever better defended than it was, till the very day that it was lost. hy as
perfect a surprise as ever was‚’⁷ thus refers to Major-General Maxwell's alleged conduct in
connexion with that surprise: ‘⁵ Whose fault that was, 1 will not take upon ine to decide, but
certain it is, that our men sent thrice for ammunition, and could not have it; and when pow-
der was had, hall was wanting, and that when Major General Maxwell, who was for that day
called to by Cormack O‘Neil's men for ammunition, he asked them often, whether they de-

signed to kill larks ?'' or, as the Irish Colonel adds, in reference to Maxwell‘s Scotch [node
of speaking, ‘⁶ lavraeks he called them.“
