Liberties, and Religion. But notwithstanding all the opposition they were able to make, by the
24th the Enemie had finished their battery of 30 pieces of Cannon and in two days more ad-
vanced their trenches within thei-ty paces of the ditch ; there was by this time a great breach in
the wall near St. John’s Gate, and part of the palessados beaten down of the (301111191591111),Π &c.

King James speaks of William's carmon as but “30 pieces,'’ and ezmawhly, since the
Williamite account of the siege, in the Londnn Gazette of September lst-4th‚ 1690, says:
‘⁴ 24111, we finished all our Batteries, on which were mounted 30 Pieces of Cannon.’' But this
statement, as to the number of William's cannou at ‘⁸ 30 pieee5,'’ was most probably owing to
the printer's having put an Ο, instead ofa 6, after the figure of 3. In the engraved Williamite
plan, entitled “ Α Prospeet of Limerielf heco-ing (lue Iseo, exctclly slzezring gf* Appi-nachar, Bae-
terc'es, amlBrem-l1‚·· &Q there are marked, on William's four hatteries of cannou, a total of
thirty-sia= pieces3 on the fifth or mortar battery, four mortars are represented3 so that the
King had employed altogether, against Limerick, a tra'm of rom-Y pieres of artillery. Of
these, besides the four mortars easting bombs into the town, twelve of the other guns are en-
graved as shooting ὅ· red hot balls.”

Captain Peter Drake, of Draherath, in the County of Meath, who was in Limeriek during
the siege, has mentioned, in connexion with the battering and bombardment of the town by
this formidable artillery, a eurious ¹· lustance‚'' as he entitles ir, ‘⁴ of the Interposition of Divine
Providence in my Belsalf, by which,’' he adds, ·‘ Ihave been so often since rescued from Cala-
mity, and the Jaws of Death.''

“ There was,'’ says he, ‘· between our House and the Town-wall, a large Magazine. The
Besiegers ordered two Pieees of Ordnance 1ο be levelled at this Building; and several Shots
passed through, and hit on the Gable-end, within which was the Apartment‚ where I slept with
0119 Captain Plunlcet¹ os Lorsl Gormanstown‘s Regiment. This Gentleman was to mount Guard
that Day, and going out very early, left me a-bed. About two Hours after, Iwent out to
speak to one of the Servants ro get me a clean Shirt, and before Ι had Time to return, a Ball
had beat down the Wall, a great Part of which had fallen on, and demolished the Bed. It then
passed through my Father's Bed-ehamber, broke the Posts of the Bed, where he and my
Mother were asleep, but, thank Heaven, had no worse Effect, than putting the Family in a
Consternation.“

The Williamite account of ‘the siege in the London Gazette, says, after the last assault and
repulse which led to the retreat of william, “Divers Deserters are come out of the Town,
who tell US, they have lost a great many Men‚and that our Cannon and Bombs have made ater-
rible Havock.'' Nevertheless, from the examination ofJohn Ryder, who bore ιιι-1115101119 place
during the siege, it appears, whatever were the number of the Irish garrison and town's-people
destroyed by the artillery, ‘⁶ That there were but a few Houses and little Hay burnt or demo-
lished in Lymerick during the siege, they‚’' adds Ryder, ⁴⁶ having covered their Hay with raw
