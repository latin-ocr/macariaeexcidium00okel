Excidium M aeariae ,· or,

Government left by Cor-idon ,· and they all answered that the Power he
left was not legall; for that by the ancient constitution and the funda-
mentall Laws of the Land, Cyprus must be governed by a King or a
Vice Roy, or, at least, by a Deputy or two, vested with the Royall
Authority; and there being noe King, Vice Roy, or Deputy‚ now in the
Kingdom, the Government was, therefore, unhinged, and the Nation at
Liberty to choose what F orme of Rule they thought most convenient
for Self-preservation. It is probable that Coridon himself was not igno-
rant that his new Modell of dividing the Power was without Law or
President; but he considered if he made Choise of Ty7=icl‹ztes for his De-
puty, (and he durst not name any other, whilst the Son of A masis was
in Cyprus), the King, who had a fond Affection for the Youth‚ might
continue him in the Employment, and lay Coridon aside; he hoped,
moreover, to be back in Cyprus, before N otice were taken of this Irregu-
larity in the Government. Whatever his Reason was to leave Matters
in that Disorder‚ the Assembly of Paphos made Use of it, in order to
depose his Creatures (or, at least, endeavour it), to whom the Manage-
ment of publick Affaires, both Civill and Military, was wholy intrusted
in his Absence.

formaaCoridone instituta sentirent. Unanimi omnium consensu responsum est,
potestatem ab eo ordinatam nullo legum adminiculo sustineri: vetustissimis
enim constitutionibus et antiquo Regni jure cautum esse, ut in Cypro aut Rex
praeesset. aut Gubernator, aut vicaria saltem potestas uni, duobus, aut ad sum-
mum tribus commissa, quibus regia authoritas inesset: cumque Regnum ea
tempestate nec Regia majestate, nec fiduciario ullo honore regeretur, succusso
imperii fundamento, gentem liberam esse, ut pro arbitrio eam regiminis for-
mam eligant quam publicae incolumitati aptissimam judicaverint. Credibile
est non fugisse Coridonem ipsum novum hunc spargendae in plures potentiae
modum, nec ullis juris placitis nec superiorum temporum exemplis niti. Anxio
autem volutaverat animo, si Tyridatem rebus praeficeret (nec alium, dum in
Insula regia soboles esset, in hunc apicem eligere audebat) ne Rex, qui juve—
nem ardenter deperibat, se excluso, dominatum illi confirmaret. Quibuscumque
denique rationibus motus est, ut res tam confusas relinqueret, regni conventus
tunc Paphi congregatus, ea occasione usus est in deponendis Coridonis amicis,
quibus solis, eo absente, civilium bellicarumque rerum cura commissa erat.
