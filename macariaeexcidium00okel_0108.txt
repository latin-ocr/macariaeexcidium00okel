Ez²eidizcm Mwarioe ; or,

Asimo, in the Kingdom of Syria, the first received Letters from his Cor-
respondents at Court, whereby lie understood that it was to noe Purpose
to hope that he might lay the Blame of past Miscarryages on the Nation
of Cyprus, who, by their gallant Defence of Paphos, acquired such a Re-
putation in the Syriam Court, that he must not think ofjustifying him-
self that Way; that noe other was now left, but to impute all the Fault
to Asimo and his Syrian Troopes. Cmidon, haveing received this Advice
uppon the Road, feigns himself indisposed‚ and altogether unable to
continue his J ourney; but, he earnestly pressed Asz’mo to hasten before
him to Court, to tell the Story which was formerly concerted between
thein3 that when he came up, he would confirm it; and soe, after many
reciprocal Endearments and Protestations of inviolable Friendship, they
parted. Deluded Asimo, makeing all the Speed he could, to give both
Kings an Accouut of the present Condition of Cyprus, (as it was for-
merly coneluded uppon between the two Friends,) told that it was a lost
Country‚ not to be retrieved; that the N ation, for the most Part, readily

submitted to the Prince of Patara, to whom they were generally in-

Syrz'am appulissent, priori litterae ex aula a familiaribus oblatae sunt, quibus
innuebatur incassum eum de praeterritis calamitatibus Cyprios criminaturum,
qui Paphum tanta fortitudine, tamque strenua egregias virtutis laude defen-
sando, usque adeo in aula Syriaca sermonibus hominum extollantur, ut alia
prorsus excogitanda sit via, qua suam innocentiam asserere possit: nihil porro
occurrere expeditis1s, quam ut culpam in Asimonem Syro-sque transferat. Cori-
don his in ipso itinere admonitus, subito adversam valetudinem causatur, seque
ferendae viarum agitationi penitus imparem simulat: Asimonem etiam atque
etiam urget obsecratque, in Regiam acceleret: ut jam olim convenerat, rela-
tionem adornet: ipsum, cum eo successisset, omnia confirmaturum. Atque ita
mutuis inter se amplexibus defuncti, promissaque in aeternum reciproca fide
digrediuntur. Fallacis amicitiae spe deceptus Asimo quanta maxima potest
celeritate accurrit, ut, prout ante cum Socio convenerat, ambobus Regibus
praesentem rerum in Cypro faciem ob oculos ponat. Confidenter enarrat In-
sulam funditus amissam, nee ullis viribus recuperari posse, gentem magna ex
parte sub ipsa initia Pacaraeo Principi sese dedidisse, reliquorum animos eo
inclinari; paucissimos illos, qui arma adhue tenuissent, et Paphi in obsidione
