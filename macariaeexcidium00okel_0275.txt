which used for centuries to be paid by England. As to its origin there, and to the then value
of the denarius? he remarks, “ it is not my business to inquire. Let it suffice to say, that it
was worth a good deal more than our present penny.'’

Respecting the value of this demuma-into which, as the coin that was to be sent from
every house in Iz-eland to Rome, in consideration of the Papal transfer ofthe island to Henry,
Doctor Lanigan, as an Irislz ecclesiastical historian, should certainly not have asserted, “it
is not my business to inquire‚”—Doctor Henry has been more explicit. 111 his learned His-
tory of Great Britain. having premised that the piece of money in question was that at the
time most commonly in use, he thus, in 1777, defines its value :—“ Every 'I'ower pound of
silver was coined into 240 of these pennies, each weighing 22} Troy grains. Twelve of these
pennies, weighing 270 grains, were paid for one shilling. In a word, the Anglo-Norman penny
was the same, in weight, with the Anglo-Saxon. Many of the former, as well as some of the
latter, are still preserved, and have been published. Though the silvei· penny of this period
was buta small coin, yet it was of considerable value3 andss' concludes the Doctor, ‘⁵ ivoiilclliane
purchased as much provisions asj'onr orfiue qfour sliillings will do a! presentff' Hence the
tribute of a denarius, stipulated by the Papal bull to be sent yearly, in the name of St. Peter,
from every house in Irelaud, to Romo, would form no inconsiderable annual remittanee froin
Ireland to Italy.

As to the authenticity of Adrian 1V.'s bull to Henry II., which some Irish writers, on ae-
count of what they considered the gross injustice ofthe document with respect to Ireland, have
attempted to treat as a forgery⁷ Dr. Lanigan says : “ Gratianus Lucius (Lynch) greatly ex-
erted himself (Cambr. Evers. cap. 22) in striving to show, that the Bul} is spurious, and Mac
Geoghegan would fain make us believe the sanie thing. It has not, indeed, been published in
the Baliarium Romanum, the editors of which were ashamed ofit. But there was a copy of it
in the vatican library. as is clear from its being referred to by Pope John XXII„ in his Brief
to Edward ΙΙ. of England, written in 1319, which Briefis in the Bullarium, and may be seen in
Wilkins‘ Cozmeils, vol. 2, p. 491, in Brodin's Descriptio Regni Hibernioe, printed at Rome in
1721, and in Mac Geoghegan's Histoire, ἂψ, tome 2. p. 116. In said Brief, the Pope not only
refers to Adrian‘s ssull or letter by name, but says that hejoins to the Brief a copy of it, for the
use of the King. And Buronius, who has published the Bull in his Annales, &c.‚ at 1159 (not
because he thought it was issued in that year) tells us, that he took his copy of it from a Codes
Vaticanus. Then we have the testimony of the very intriguer employed in procuring this
Ball, John of Salisbury ..... ‘ Ad preces meas illustri regi Anglorum Henrieo ΙΙ. concessit
(Adrianus) et dedit Hiberniam jure haereditario possidendam, sient litterae ipsius testantur in
hodiernum diem. Nam omnes insulae de jure antiqu0‚ ex donatione Constantini qui eam fun-
davit et dotavit, dicuntur ad Romanam ecclesiam pertinere: '' ..... Doctor Lanigan, then,
showing that this passage of John of Salisbury, which Lynch denied to be John’s, as not find-
ing it in his Polycratieusg is to be found in his Metalogicus‚ thus proceeds: ⁴‘ Adrian‘s grant
of Ireland to Henry is expressly mentioned and confirmed by Pope Alexander ΙΙΙ., 111 his
letter to him of the year 1172. Giraldus Cambrensis (de rebus α se gestis, pars 2, cap. ll,
