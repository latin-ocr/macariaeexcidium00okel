The river Boyne fordahle in several places, yet, as it is objecteeL no trench was cast up, for the
dejence of those fords.

In Harris's plan of the site of the principal engagement at the Boyne‘, 01· the ground
between the village of Old-Bridge and Drogheda‚ there are no less than five fords set down, in
front of James's position. Four of these fords are marked as traversable by infantry, and the
fifth by cavalry. The first, L, at Old-Bridge, was that by which the Dutch Blue Guards
erossed3 the second and third, M, were those by which the Freneh Protestants and Ulster
Protestants erossed; the fourth, N, was that by which Sir John Hanmer's regimem and Count
Nassau's crossed3 and the fifth, a ford for cavalry, marked O, and the nearest to Drogheda,
and farthest from Old-Bridge‚ was that by which William himself, and his left wing of horse
crossed. As for the remainder of the ground, or that extending from Old—Bridge to Slane-
Bridge, Harris's plan marks, with the letter R, between those places, a sord, ⁴‘ where ye
Right wing of the English Horse passed ;'' King Jaines says “the river was fordable (tllmoxt
every where ,·'⁷ Story states, of the English right wing, under Lieutenant-General Douglas and
Count Scbonberg (the old Marshal's son), which attacked in that direction, “ the Right Wing
at first were ordered to pass all at Slmze, but being better inform’d, several Regiments were
commanded to pass at other Furdx between our Camp and that Place ;'’ and William's friend
and Marechal-de-Camp in the engagement, the Earl of Portland, who acted in this quarter,
along with Donglas and young Schonberg. speaks of “other fords,'' as ‘¹ two or three other
fords, about three miles higher than our ca1np.’'

From King James's account, at the end of Note 1⁶24, it has been seen, that he endeavoured
to secure the principal ford, at Old-Bridge, by works. And the King's assertion is corrobo-
rated by Story, who, in describing the advance, through the river, of the Dutch Blue Guards,
against Old-Bridge, says : “ The Irz'sh had lined the Houses, Breastworlzs, and Hedges beyond
the River with my Lord Tyrcomzel's Regiment of Foot Gumis, and some other Companies.''
Then, having mentioned, that ¹⁴ they had posted also seven Regiments of Foot about 150 Yards
backwards,” he adds, they “ stood drawn up behind some little Hills, to shelter themfrom our
Camzon, which played all this whiless’ But this ford could not be ‘¹ mentained,’' although “ in-
trenched‚'' as the King says, or strengthened by those lined “houses’' and “breastworks'’
spoken of by Story; because, as Pere d'Orleans observes os the defenders‚ “ on fut trop forte-
ment pousse par le canon, δι par la superioria} du nombre.’'
