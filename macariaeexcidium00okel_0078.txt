by Coriclon, in reg-ard he was more knowing in the Art of Warr than

Design, if those two great Men continued in the Kingdom. At the same
Time, Coridon gott himself rid of Illontoclea who was to comand the
6000 young Soldiers sent to Syria, in Exchange for soe many more
of the veteran Army which were come from thence under the Comand

Moutocles, who could not endure Coridon's haughty Humor, was not
