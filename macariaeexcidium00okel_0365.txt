King James's Memoirs give a very different representation of his conduct on this head.
They say, that the King, ⁴* 501119 111119 before the beginning of the Canipaign‚'‘ had undertaken
·‘ to prepare all things necessary for takeing the field, which in a manner lay wholly upon him-
self3 wherefore the. pains he took were innnence, and people were astonishexl 119 was able to
support 5ο prodigious a fatigue ; and had he been well seconded, or his orders effectually exe-
cuted, he would haue thought himself happy, but for want of that, the greatest part of what he
did, was lost Iabour: There was scarce any magazines upon the frontiers ths· he had taken
measures for them, so that not only 1119 Λ1Ὶ1119, but the very Town of Dublin was upon the
point of wanting bread, if not supplyd from ab1-0a‹l; lte was made tn heliano fin· vcaune time lte
lmcl 50 thousand men, and paid them accordingly, thr] lte lzmlnot 18 thousand eset-hue : his Artil-
lery, amunition, Sec„ which Monsieur de Lausune brought from France, remain’d at Cork for
want of carriages to make them moue, while the King had the ‹lissatisfaction to see every day
the POE of Granges shipps pass unmolested through the Channel, with troops and all necessa-
rys for the Northv: This made him press the Ministers of the Court of France to send their
fleet into St George‘s Channel, and either transport his small Army into England, or at least
inter-cept the English sending theirs into Ireland3 but their ears were still shut to all such
proposalls, either through the Minister's aversness, or the disponding relations which con-
tinually came from Mons* D'Avaux and the French Officers; who generally instead of assist-
ing the King in that extremity, pull'd each a different way; nor were they much aflicted in
the bottom, to see things go 50 ill, because it verifyd their accounts, and recommended their
judgtuent: In fine such were the wants, disunion and dijection, that the Kings affairs looked
like the primitive Cahos, and yet his courage and aplication fail'd him not.''
