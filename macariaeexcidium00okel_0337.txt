Notes and I llu-strations. 305

it would ruin his Majestys reputation with his Protestant Subjects of England and Scotland,
that it would ruin the trade by a removeall of Protestant Merchants efects‚ and destroy the
publici< faith, on which no one would dare to rely, if Acts of Parliament be no security; it
was inconveniant, he Sayd, 111 point of time, as not being seasonable to look after vineards
when civil war was rageing in the Nati0n‚ and when an invasion threaten'd it3 it was like
divideing the skin before the beast was catch'd. that it would draw men from his Majestys
service, whose eyes and hearts would be more upon their own concerns, than the King's
business3 and concludes, that in case there was a Rebellion in King Chai-les the first's time
(which he sayd he owned in his Eikon Basilikfi), and Signed the Act for secui-ing the Adven-
turer‘s mony for suppressing it, then he thought some discrimination ought to be made be-
twixt the guilty and inocent, but that the bill made no distinction at all.

“ The Lord Chiefjustice Keating to back this, drew up a long adress to the King, to the
same purpose, enlargeing upon all the hardshipps‚ inconveniencies, and distractions it would
bring along with it, that it would be the ruin of trade and future improvements, when the
foundation of the general settlement was once undone, and that Act rendcr'd void ex post
sacto, which was good security when the purchass was made, that the catholic-k purchassors
would suffer with others3 wherefore he beg'd that some composition might be thought of, by
prescribeing more moderate ways than by depriveing so many persons of their all, w¹¹ they
had legally and industriously acquired, and that a Committee of both Houses might be ap-
pointed to enquire, whether some medium could not be found out, to accommodate as near
as possible, both the Purchassers and old Proprietors.

“ Itis certayne‚'’ observe the royal Memoirs, “that many of the wise and judicious Ca-
tholicks thought such an aecommodation very practicable 3 that the great improuements had
so enhaunced the value of most estates, as would allow the old Proprietors a share of equal
income to what their Ancestors lost, and yet leave a competency for the Purehassers, who might
reasonably be allowed the benifit of their own labours ς and in such turbulent times and diffi-
cult circumstances, it was just that all pretenders should recede (in some degree) from the
full of their pretentions for the accommodatiori ofthe whole ; no side being so apt to grumffle,
when all men share in the burthen, especially it being of that consequence to prevent an uni-
versal discontent, both sor the King's present necessitys‚ the publick quiet and general safety
os the people.

“ There is no doubt but the King's inolinations were the same ; he saw the distraction it
would breed, how it would inflame the Protestants, and rob him of his most serviceable Catho-
licks, ruin the trade, and sink the revenue, but he east not his own intrest into the ballance,
he sougbt to do what he conceiu'd most just, and in order to it informed himself the best
he could what were their reasons and arguments, to get a true notion of the pretensions on
both sides‘'¹¹.
