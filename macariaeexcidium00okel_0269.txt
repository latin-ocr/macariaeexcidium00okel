at a more recent period, or since the Anglo-Norinan invasion, and the great ‹loctrinal revo-
lution of the sixteenth century, has Ireland been designated ‘⁶ The island of Saints.” The
last generallymeeognised Irish Saint was Lorcan O'Tuathal, or Laurence O'Toole, Arch-

bishop of Dubliny, who died at Eu, in Normandy‚ November 14, 11802.

³ Nevertheless, the above accounts, though so
honourable to those to whom they applied, and so
sar to the country with which such piety andlearn-
ing were connected, are not to be received in the
enlarged or general sense with respect to the Irish,
111 which some would have those accounts under-
stood. Mae Geoghegan, the substance of whose
ohservations on this point will bc found confirmed
by a general perusal of the native annals of the
times in question, remarks ot¹ his countrymcn, in
the ages referred to: ‘⁴ Les sciences qui 'celairent
et qni ornent l'esprit florissoient plus qn’aillem·s
chez eux. La morale chri-tienne, qui segle lcs mou-
vemens du coeur, formoit parmi eux 1105 hommes
d'une haute reputation, pour la saintetc de leurs
moeurs. Cependant, malgre ces avantnges, on voyoit
clicz eux une milanye ι”ῑυιιηαηίε de verli! et (Ie vice,
et comme dit un certain auteur, ils ctoicnt ardens en
tout, soit dans lc bien, soit dans le mal z 1η omnes

ce peuple se consacroit entierement ’ξι Dieu par un
rcnoncement parfait au monde, ct servoit en cela ‹le
modele aux nations voisines, l'esprit de discorde
fut toujours nourri chez eux, soit par la tyrannio
de leurs princeS, soit par l‘amhition de leurs nobles,
soit par les frequentes revoltes de leurs snjcts.''
