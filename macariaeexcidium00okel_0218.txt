Notwithstanding the wonder expressed in the text at the loyalty of the Irish to Charles IL,
the contemporary memorials of the Revolution of 1688 show how a Prince, even when a still
more ‘⁵ zealous opponent of the Roman Catholic rites‚'' was not the less faithfully served by
numbers of that religion, though the circumstance has not been duly noticerl in our printed
