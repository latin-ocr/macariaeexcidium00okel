them, and noe visible Way now left sor Self—preservation, but to trcat
with Theodore, who likely, at that Time, would give them any Con-
ditions‚ that he might be at Liberty to joyne with the Rest of the
Confederates, in order to attack Syria on all Sides. But the Gene-
rality of the Cjspovisli Nation were osan other Scntiment3 not expeeting
the Performance of any Treaty with the Cilic-iaus, who infringed soe
often the publick Faith. In a grand Councill at Papho& it was concluded
to dispatch two Persons of Quality into Syria, to signisy their present
Condition and Resolution to defend the Country, not doubting but An-
tiochus would powerfully support them, for it was his true Interest to
give leeodore &Vork in Cyprus. It was also resolved 111 that Consuh,
that Lysander, the Darling of the Army, should eomand in chief, next
to the Captain Grenerall. NVhen these Rcsults were made known to Cori-
