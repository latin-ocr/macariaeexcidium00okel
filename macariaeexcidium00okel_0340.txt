as well as the lrish Protestants in general. The Rev. Andrew Hamilton, Protestant Rector of
Kilskerrie, and one of the Prebendaries of the Dioeese of Clogher, in 1690, says:—“ All our
Bishopries and Livings that fell in 1110 King's Gist, were kept vacant, and the Revenues given
to the Popish Clergy. Their Bishops kept public Visitations in the vacant Dioceses, and
assumed even the Tit11÷3 one of whom was made Secretary of State, and signed himself by the
Name of his Bishoprie in all his Warrants and Dispatches‚ that none might plead Ignoranee
of the King's Intentions towards us. And we were told by some in the highest Plaee, That
the King would fill no protestant Vacancies in the Church, 50 that we saw great Part of our
Churches in their Possessiom and Nothing interpose, but the Lives of a very few (and most of
them) old Men, to leave us not one Protestant Bishop in the Kingdom. And for our Civil
Rights, our Judges, Justioes of the Peaee, Sheriffs, and even Constabies, were for the most
Part made of Papists : And the Act of Settlement was then doomed in every Coffee-house to
the same Condemnation under which it. has fallen since. And the Army being entirely in those
worst of Popish Hands, the most barbarous Irish who had thrown off Humanity it sels, our
Prospect was all black and dismal.” See, however, Note 86.

Of King James‘s kindness to the Irish Roman Catholic clergy, there are various proofs,
in the official correspondenee in the State Paper Office, London. The Earl of Sunderland,
writing from Whitehall, as prin01pal Secretary of State, to the Earl of Clarendon, as Viceroy
of Ireland, March 20th, 1683, says: ‘⁶ My Lord, Doctor Dominiek Maguire‚ the Roman
Catholick Archbishop and Primate of Armagh, being now going for Irekmd, his Majesty
commands me 1ο recommend to your Excellency the said Archbishop, and also Doctor Patrick
Tyrrell, Bishop of Clogher and Kilmore, and the rest of their brethren, 1110 Archbishops and
Bishops of the Roman Catholick communion in Irelund‚ for your patronage and protection
upon all occasions, wlzerein they shall apply ιιηὶο you, or stand inueetl tlzereqsl . . . . His Majesty
would likewise have your Excellency recommend it to the Archbishops, 1315110115, Sheriffs, and
Justices of 1110 Peace there, not to molest the Roman Catholici< clergy, in the exercise of their
eeclesiasticam functions, amongst those of their own communion.“ James himself, in a letter,
dated from Whitehall, two days after, or on the ⁴22nd of March, 1683, and inscribed ⁴‘ To the
Most Reverend Father in God, Dominick¹¹ [Maguire] “ Archbishop of Armagh, Primate of
our Kingdom of Ireland? grants yearly pensions to the Archbishop and others of his cle—
rical brethren. The letter of his Majesty, after reeiting, how he had directed certain sums of
money to be issued to the Archbishop, from time to time, out of the treasure remaining in the
Exchequer of the Kingdom of Ireland, adds: “ Our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby
authorise you to remim, for your owne use, out of the said moneys so to be received by you,
