Eoecz'dium Ilsaoariae; or,

Subinission, they were not a little surprized to hear of Lysander's fortu-
nate Success in defeating the Convoy comeing to Theodore's Camp from
Salamis, and destroying the great battering Engines, the Provisions‚ and
all other Instruments of WVarr, which gave such an Encouragement to
the (jqslrarians, that they laid aside all Thoughts of capitulating. It was
much taken Notice of, how Coridon and Asimo, with all their Partizans,
were erest-fallen uppon the Newes; sor thc Sgsrisms saw that it delayed
theire Return, and Coridou's Creatures understood well that it ruined
theire Projcct. They made it therefore their Business to villify and ridi-
cule that bravo Action, saying it was Folly to think such an Accident,
which was inconsiderable in itself, could hindei· the Loss of Papho& or
promote the Preservation of Cyprus. That the advantageous Artieles
that might be now obtained from Theodora, before the Suri-ender of
Pssplaos, could not be rationally expected aster thc Loss of that Place‚
which must infallibly huppen within a. few Daycs3 and the Syrien Troops
being resolved to goe off, it was to be feared that the Cypriane, looscing
Paphos, and desertcd by theire Allyes, would gett no other Conditions

Lysandrum egregi& felicitate nec minore virtute Praesidiarios, qui Salamine in
Theodori castra missi erant, ex improviso adortum fudisse, et machinas arie-
tandis moenibus aptas, commeatus, aliaque belli instrumenta, sul:›jectis ignibus
absumpsisse, ae penitus disperdidisse, renuntiatum suisset: quae in tantum
quriorzwn animos virtutis {emulatione stimularunt, ui omne icendorum soede-
rum consilium prorsus aversarentur. A multis non immerito observatum est,
quantum Ooridon Asz'moque cum reliquis earundem partium hominibus adina
nuntia ceciderint animis: Syri enim expectatum reditum sibi eo eventu prae-
clusum impraesentiarum viderant; coridon cum Asseclis consilia sua eversa
atque interrupta intellexerant: Quod igitur tunc supererat unum, egregium
tanti facinoris decus deterendo et verbis levando maligne traducere statue-
runt, haud prudentium esse, dictitantes, arbitrari, tam exigui momenti casu
aut Paphi excidium impediri posse aut ullam Cypro securitatem procurari:
aequas pacis conditiones, quas stante Papho a Theodoro obtinerent, ezidem jam
exeis& aut dedita (quorum alterutrum mox futurum sit) nullo modo expectari
a vera sentientibus posse, et Syris jam profectionem adornantibus, verendum
esse, ne Cyprii a Confoederatis deserti, et socialibus destituti auxiliis, non alias
