cians (of which, however, they assured him there was not the slightest
sear) continue inveterately in rebellion, that it would be far better that
the island should remain under their sway, than that either the domi-

whom he showed but slight inclination), should enjoy its dominion; a
wondrous instance, in sooth, of the inconstancy and ingratitude of that
Prince's mind, who had so often boasted that he was lineally descended
from the Galamz'nz'an Kings of Cyprus, and who had been himself the Milesiam. In·-
son os a Syovtan Prinoess, had been nurtured amidst the youthful nobility ῙῙἛἿΚΙΙ,
of Syria, and there imbibed his first knowledge of the art cf war, and Franco.
who now, in his deelining years, expelled by the wickedness cf his own
