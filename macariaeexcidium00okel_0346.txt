Lorcl Momztcashel incorrectly supposed to have fizilecl in capturing Crom Casae, from α want
ofany artillery.

The notion of Colonel O'Kelly, as to the Irish having been without artsslery, before Crom
Castle, is erroneous. The Rev. Andrew Hamilton, under the date of Sunday, July eeth,
1689, says: “ There came an Express from Crom to the Governour, (of Enniskillen) ac-
quainting him, That Lieutenant-Geueral Macarty had mareh'd his Men from Belturbet, and
was come before Crom, and was raising a Battery to play upon tlte Casae.- . . . . and the next
Day, on llIzcnday-morning the 29th of July, by an other Express from Crom, we were in-
form'd, that Lieutenant-General Macco-ty had began to batter tlte Castle wilh his Cannon,” &c.
The same Enniskillen authority states, in his account of the Subsequent overthrow of the
lrish force at Newton-butler, “ we took seven Cannam* and in King James's Memoirs, the
capture of “camon'' from his army there is likewise acknowledged'‘.

NOTE 100, Page 37.

The Enniskillz'ners believed to leave been strongly reitgforced hy the English, at the qffaz'r os
Nemeen-Butler, Jaly Slst (0. 8.), 1689, hut not, in reality, joined by any more English,
than afew ezperffincezl Officers.

It does not appear from the Rev. Andrew Hamilton, or from any other source of infor-
mation which the writer of this note has met with, that the Enniskilliners received any aid
in men from the English fleet and land-force under Major-General Kirlze, except a few good
Officers. They, landing at Ballyshannon on Friday, the *2th1 of July, and hearing there of
Lord Mounteashel's having been at Belturbet with his forces, proceeded on Saturday, the
27th‚ to Belleek, on Sunday, the *28th‚ to Enniskillen by water, and were finally present at
the affair of Nomou-Butler, on the following VVednesday, July sslst, 1689. Ainongst those
Officers, was Colonel William Wolseley, who commanded the Enniskssleners, on that occa-
sion. The report mentioned by Colonel O'Kelly, as to the Enniskilliners having been rein-
forced by troops from England, may have arisen, either from such a rumour having been pur-
posely circulated by the Enniskilliners in connexion with the landing of those few Officers;
or from an exaggeration, on the. part of the country Irish, naturally occasioned, in a time of
general alarm, by that landing‚ and the circumstance of Kirke’s fleet and troops having been,
for a considerable period, off the coasts. But, from whatever cause originating, such “news''
would be beneficial to the Enniskilliners, in proportion to its being discouraging to their

opponentsd.
