method of keeping men to their duty3 sor their was no chastizeing nor even reprimanding an
Officer, for he presently cryd, He would serue no longer, and there was no obligeing them to
it without pay3 nor was it possible to keep the Soldiers togather without subsistance at least,
whereas for a long time, ere the fleet arriued from France, they were reduced to halfe apound
a bread a day to each Soldier, and even wood was grown so scarce that the French Intendant
at Galway, proposed the sending bisket rather than meal, there not being wherewithall to
hake it; that they had been forced to buy the ruins os houses and old ships for bakeing the
flouer they had already, and that now instead of deserters comeing to theme, the excessiue
misery ocoasion'd great desertion amongst the Irish themselues’'f.

NOTE 208, Page 114.

T lte arrival ofLiezctenmzt- Generul St. Ruth most earnestly desired hy thegeuerctlity of the Irz'sh,
but deluyecl so long, that tlze most cotficleut began to doubt ⁰f its taking place.

“ It was now the begining of May and there was yet no news of the Fleet‚ tho for a month
they had been reduced to eat hors flesh, nor had the Soldiers seen a bit of hread, nor any sort
of drink but water, for abone that time: besides by the account which My Lord Tyrconnel had
of what this Fleet would bring when it came, he perceiued it would fall infinitly short of sup-
plying them with those necessary& that were in a manner indispensebly required3 there was
so little mony‚ and so small a quantity of provisions, that all My Lord Tyrconnel aimed at
was only to giue the Soldiers, euch ιι penny (ι (lay, and their broad, with rations to the Officers
in 111-0110111011, yet upon computation he found it would not reach for two months, unless the
King sent a thousand pistoles more, which he earnestly beg'd of his Majesty to doe, tho he
spared it out of his small allowance, and retrenched it from the necessary expence of his family.
Thus was the King press'd and teazed with more vehemence, as the difficulty of answering
their expectations encreased ; it was a grievous affliction to him, not (to) be able to relieve
them, but he could not do impossible things.''

“This put the Irish under a necessity of equiping‚ paying, cloatlfing, and provisleing for
an Army, in a manner without mony, cloaths, amunition, or provisions, except what came
from France. which was so little, and so long a comeing, that they had all like to haue
perished ere it arriued, and yet were under a necessity all the while of repaireing their fortifi-
oations, tho the poor Soldiers had scarce a piece of bread to eat, or a handful of straw to ly
upon, when they return’d tired from their worke; so that under such an universal indigence,
togather with want of discipline, and union amongst themselves, it was a miracle they brought

it so far as they did&
