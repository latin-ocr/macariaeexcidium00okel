Tlte inhabitants of Galway (had they stood a siege) could not miss getting as good conditz'ons
llze last day as they got at first, and much moreto tlzez‘r credit.

Israel Fielding, sometime acting Secretary to the Williamite Lords Justices for Ireland,
writing from Dublin Castle‚ July 6th, 1691 (or six days before the battle ofAughrim), to Ge-
neral Ginkell‘s Secretary‚ George Clarke, respecting the very favourable conditions, already
agreed upon at the Castle, to be offered to the people of Galway‚ in order to induce them the
more readily to submit, remarks : ‘⁴ The latitude given the Galwaynists is very large, but 'tis

worth our while to get the town, almost at any ratem.

One oftlze Civil llffigistrales, tlze son ⁰f an Englislmzan and a Protestant, escaped to Ginkell’s
camp, hythe contrivcmce of tlte first Civil Illagz'strate, as z'l was then believed ; who was

Attack; that D' Ussmze, the French Lieuteuant General, was there, and that my Lord Dillon
was Governour‚ and that the Irish expected Balzlerick ODmmel, with his Par-ty to come into
Town, by way of Ire Conanght, without whom they were not in a Condition to make Resis-
tanee.'' Nevertheless, as the civilian spoken of by Colonel O'Kelly is subsequently men-
tioned by him, as having gone to Ginlcell and given him insormation at Aughrim, three
days after the battle, or three days sooner than this Mr. Shaw is said by Story to have done,
it would appear, that the Milesian Colonel and the Williamite Chaplain had in view two diffe-

The “first Civill Magistrate'⁷ mentioned by Colonel O’Kelly, as having been ari-ested
in Galway‚ for disaffection to King James’s government, was the Mayor, Arthur French‚
