alterum uxori legitimae, tertiam propriis exequiis relinquentes. Et si forte prolem legitimam
non habuerint, bona ipsa inter ipsum et uxorem in duo media dividantur. Et si legitima
uxor decesserit, inter ipsum et liberos bipartiri debent.

On which decrees of the Synod, Cambrensis (as Doctor Lanigan has observed) exclairns :
“Dignum etenim, etjustissimum est, ut sicut dominum et regem ex Anglia sortita est divinitus
Hibernia3 sic etiam exinde vivendi formam accipiant meliorem. Ipsi namque regi magnifico
tam ecclesiam'quam regnum Hiberniae debent, quicquid de bono pacis, et incremento religionis
hactenus est assecuta. Nam ante ipsius adventum in Hiberniam multimoda malorum genera
a multis retro temporibus ibidem emerserant; quae ipsius potentia et munere in desuetudinem
abiere.‘' Then, respecting the lrish Primate Gelasius, at that time in his eighty-fifth year,
Cambrensis adds: “Ardmachiensis vero primas ob corporis imbecillitatem, et grandaevitatem.
tuin praesens non fuerat3 sed postea Dubliniam venit, regiae dispositioni per omnia favorem
praebens, vulgi opinione vir sacer vaccam candidam, cujus solum lacte vescebatur, secum
quodeunque venerat, circumducens !'' From the circumstance of Gelasius not being mentioned
in this last and apparently best account of the Synod of Cashel as present there with his bro-
ther Archbishops of Cashel, Dubiin, and Tuam, and the further statement of Cambrensis to
the same effect, it would follow, that the previously-cited Anglo-Norman chroniclers‚ Benedict,
Hoveden, and Gervase, though correct as to thesba, have been in error as to the time, of
the lrish Primate's having personally submitted to Henry, which does not seem to have been
until after the Metropolitans of Leinster‚ Munster, and Connaught had formally acknowledged

Malachy is represented as having successfully strug-
gled to remedy, in those parts of Ulster. And,
through the provisions of the sixth and seventh
decrees of this assembly at Cashel, in connexion
with confessors and confession, any such neglect ot*
confession would seem to be more specially provided
against for the future; in accordance with the ge-
neral spirit of the acts of that first Synod under the
Anglo-Norman regime, by which, the practice of
Irelaml, in all spiritual matters, was theneefor-
ward to be regulated according to the usage of the
Church elsewhere in general, and to that of the
Church of England in particular.—(Lanigan⁷s Ec-
clesiastical History of Ireland, vol. iv. pp. 59-63,
