Reckoning, as it appears, from the beginning of the general engagement, though not spe-
cifying at what honr that began, the contemporary Dutch account of the battle in Freneh says
of the Irish: ‘⁶ Ils commencerent a fuir det cutes partes, apres avoir combatu environ trois
beures.”

The letter from Dublin ofJuly l5th‚ 1691, to Narcissus Luttrel, cited in Note 234, like-
wise without particularizing the hour when the general engagement commenced, alleges, that
“ the combat lasted with great bravery near 3 lmurs.'¹

The Williamite Secretary, John Davis, writing to Colonel John Michelburne from ‘⁶ Dublin
Castle, the l5th ofJuly‚ 1691,‘’ and premising, “ This Morning by an Express we have an Ac-
count of a very great Victory gained over the Enemy, the Particulars whereof are as follow-
eth,'' says: “About six oftbe Cloclz on Snnday in the Evening, the Bateez began at a Place call’d
Agbrim in the County of GalZways' and he adds: “ The Battel insted about 3 Hours, and had
not tlze Night overtaken us, in all Probability the Slaughter had been much greater, we persued
the Enemy 5 Miles'¹¹¹, &c. Since Davis, as Secretary to the Williamite Lords Justices for
lreland, must have read the original express from Ginkell, respecting his victory, to the Casae,
this letter of the Secretary to Colonel Michelburne may so far be considered to embody Gin-
kell's own statements, or those of his Seeretary, George Clarke, respecting the honr the
general engagement commenced, and the time which elapsed, before it was terminated by the
defeat of the last body of the Irish who stood their ground, or the cavalry on the side of
Urrachree.

Major Tempest and Captain Dunbar, both in Ginkell's army at the battle, and, as it ap-
pears, on the English right wing, directed against the pass of Aughrim, where the Irishfirst
gave way= assign to the same hour as Secretary Davis's letter does, or to about 6 o'clock, the
beginning of the general engagement between the two armies. The Major's words are, after
describing the preliminary operations, “ at siz in the evening begun the fight.‘· The Captain,
after a similar preliininary‚ says it eommenced “about six at night.’' The Major mentions
nothing further as to time. The Captain informs us, that, “ on the right‚’' or, as previously
observed‚ where he and the Major appear to have been, “the dispute lasted very sharply for
about two hours or more, and then,” he adds, “we had the slaughtering of them for four
miles’'³‚ &c. The words “ or more'’ applied to what is stated as a “two lzonrs”’ very sharp

dispute even on the Aughrim side, will very readily allow of the lapse ofa third, or about α
third bour, before the completion of Ginkell's victory on the other wing, at Urrachree.
