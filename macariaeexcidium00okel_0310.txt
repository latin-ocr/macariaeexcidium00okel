However, though but too many of the old Iris-h, belonging to the clans or septs in the
vicinity of the Anglo-Norman or English settlements, would appear 10 have been reduced to a
very low condition by such principles and hostilities 00 the side of the “settlers,” still to

time, in a great degree, disappointed. The Irish re-entered most of the countries they had
lost, and reduced the English Pale to narrow limits, wherein the possessors were strait-

ened from the continued hostilities of the borderersj, who became very expert soldiers, and,

indeed, the best in 1116 kingdom.
