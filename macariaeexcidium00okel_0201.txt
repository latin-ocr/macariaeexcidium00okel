following short notice: “ At St. Omers, in Flanders, as I am informed, was heretofore a
seminat-y for secular Irish priests; but at present‚'’--that is, about the middle of the last cen-
tury, his book being printed in 1762‚—“there is no such thing. I am‚'' he adds, “ a stranger
how it came to have an end.''

Of the Iris-h College at Antwerp,-the mention of which is connected with the present
work through the name of O'Reilly, one of whom was president there, and another, the Rev.
John ()'Reilly, the translator of Colone] O'Kelly's work into Latin‚—Harris says the institu-
tion, like the other Irish Colleges in Flanders. was subject to the College of Douny, founded,
in 15911, by the Rev. Christopher Cusack, who, by the expenditure of his own patrimony, and
the pecuniary assistance of his friends, was enabled to form this, as well as other educational
establishments, for his countrymen, in Belgium. The Rev. Mr. Roehe, President of the
(Jollege of Douay, and subsequently Roman Catholie Bishop of Ross in lreland, at what year
is not exaetly stated, but apparently not long after the foundation of Douay (stodlege, and
certainly previous to the year 1629, through the exertions ofhimselfansl his friends, first
formed an establishrnent for Irish priests at Antwerp, where they were supported “ partly hy
the alnis given at masses, and partly by the benevolence of the people.'' ‘⁸ Burs* adds Harris,
‘⁸ the College of Antwerp, dedicated to St. Patrick, for Irish secular priests. may justly be
said to owe its foundation to Mr. Laurenee Sedgrave, apriest, probably of the diocese of
Meath, th in 1629, bought the house and garden for 1:3,320 florens, and erected it into a
national Irish CoHege, by the consent of the then Bishop of Antwerp‚ for twelve or sixteen
priests, and he was the first president of it himself.'' Having stated that, in the reception of
students at this College, there was observed ⁴‘ an equality of Provinees,’' or, in other words,
that a similar number of students were admissible from Leinster, Ulster, C0n11aught,an(l
Munster, Harris refers, for further information on this College, to a work denoininated
“ Principium, Progressus, :ie Praesens Status Collegii Pastoralis Hibernorum, Antwerpiffl‚'*

From the eminenee, in his day, of the previously-mentioned Nicolaus Vernulaeus, as a
professor and writer in Belgium3 his friendliness to the Irish; the period during which he
appears, by the dates of his works, to have flourished, or that of Colonel O'Kelly*s youth 3
and the little difference between the unknown ⁶· Verulenus” of the text, and the known or
real appellation of ‘⁴ Ve1·nulaeus;'' the former seems to have been‚inteuded only as a slight
disguise of the actual name of the Colonel's eloquent preceptor. At all events, the writer of
this note has searched in vain for the name or works of [my professor, either in Belgium or
elsewhere, called ¹¹ Verulenus.'' Of ‘⁵ Vernulaeus,'' O'Flaherty‚ the learned author of Ogygia,
