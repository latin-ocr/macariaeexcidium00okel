they encamped ten or twelve days, to countenance the workmen.¹'

A well-informed, though anonymons, local writer, having mentioned, in 1826, respecting
the great modern improvements of the Castle of Bur, “ the externa] building cannot be easily
described, so various are its towers, flankers, battlements, and embrasures‚'’ adds, “ on the
eastern side yet stands part of that venerable fabric which baffled the attempts of General
Sarsfield, of whose unsuccessful cannonading in 1690, it still exhibits the marks''³.

The Duke ofBerwich‚ onan alarm (ψ’ α hostile force aduam-ing to relieve the place he was altach-

Shannon into Connaught‚ though haring superior numbers to the enemy.

Whether Brigadier Sarsfield did οι· did not protest against a retreat towards the Shan-
non on the approach of the English to relieve Birr, the Duke of Berwick's opinion previ-
ously cited, as to the lrish force having been too unequal to the large number oftbe enemy
to render an engagement prudent, is supported by the unpublished statement of Clarke, the
Williamite Secretary of War for Ireland, who calculated upon victory, in case of an action,
on account of the very superior numbers of the English. Writing to his correspondent from
“ Cashell, Sept. l9th‚ 1690? Clarke says: ‘⁶ My Lord, the guns I sent ys Lordship word in my
last, that were heard in the Camp, prove to be Sarsfleld's at Burr, w‘h place be had invested,
but upon the approach of Sir John Lanier quitted again. Sr John gives an account, that the
body of the Irish that were there, consisted of 7 battallions of foot, 6 regiments os horse, ἃ 4
of dragoones, δε that they had 7 great guns with them ; he adds in a postcript that he heard
they were returning upon advice of his marching back to Rosecrea, wo· news has made L'
Gen¹¹ Douglas, Major General Kirke, ἃ himself resolve to return 8: use all means possible to
fight him, of which we every moment expect a good account, our men being so much superium·
