vi Editor& Prszace.

the Editor of the present edition, when in London that year, was
politely presented with a copy by Mr. Croker.

From these four copies, what appeared the best readings have been
carefully selected3 the oldest forms of expression and orthography
have been generally preferred ; and, in fine, a suitable differenoe in
the mode of printing has been adopted, between the more ancient
portion of the text alluded to, and that only translated from the
Latin, and already specified, as having been consequent& enclosed in

been the great resemblance he perceived between certain occur-rences
then recent in Europe, and several circumstances related in the Colo-

1745-6 of the grandson of King James 11„ Prince Charles Edward
Stuart, to recover his grandfather's crowns3 that enterprize, like the
Jacobite war in Ireland, having occurred during a war with France,
having been supported, though inadequately, by the same power,
and having deprived the Stuarts of any chance, they might have had,
of the crowns of England and Scotland, as the contest described
by Colonel O'Kelly had stripped the same dynasty of the crown of
Ireland.

Harris, in the Preface to his Life of King William 111, published
in 1749, says ε “ Ι first undertook this task at a time when his Majesty‘¹
