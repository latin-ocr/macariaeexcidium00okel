After the battle ofAztglzrz'm‚ the Duke onyrcomzell sent α messenger to K ing James, to repre-
sent all was lost, and that no other resource remained, than for Ireland soon to submit to
Willz'am.

¹* My Lord Tyrconnel was got to Limerick before this,’· according to King James's Me-
moirs, “ and was making all the preparations he could for a defence, for upon the death of
St, Ruth he began to reassume his former authority, so immediately dispatched an express to
St. Germains, to beg either a speedy succour, or leaue to make conditions for themselves. The
King who was hugely affiicted at this mssfortune, and abundantly sencible of the hard cir-
comstances the Irish were reduced too, faird not to lay their necessities open to his Most
Christian Majesty⁰‚ telling him, That after the many hardships they had suffer'd‚ and difficultys
they had struggled with, it was necessary some speedy resolution should be taken in reference
to them; that as he was resolved, on one hand, not to consent to any thing that was disadvan-
tagious to France, so it was neither sutable to his inclination, nor the cause for which he suf-
serd, to let the best and faithfullest of his subjeets labour in vain against such a superiour
strength, with no other prospect than to be most oruelly butcher’d in the end by the declared
enemies both of England and France. This was too reasonable a request not to be complyd
with, and accordingly some succours were prepared. and some mony order'd to be sent, but
the Enemie pressed too hard to giue any great hopes they could wait the relies which was to
come from a Country so remote 3 this made My Lord Tyreonnel aprehend the Army would
capitulate in spite of his teeth, and many persons of distinction were so much inclined that
way, as had like to haue brought it about even before the enemie apear’d in sight of the
Town''‘².
