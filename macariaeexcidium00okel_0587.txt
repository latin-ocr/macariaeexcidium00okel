in putting the work substituted for it into the printer‘s hands3 and it is hoped
that the Society will therefore excuse the late appearance of this work. It will
eontain also the curious French account of the campaign of William III. in
Ireland, by Mons. Dumont, who was 1111 eye-witness of what he relatos. This
very interesting narrative has never before been published, and will supply the
historian of the Revolution with new and important matter. The Soeiety is
aware that we arc indcbted for the use of the original autogra11>h manuscript,
from which the work is printed, to the kindness and public spirit of the Very
Rev. the Dean of Ossory.

‘⁶ On the whole, it is hoped that this volume will prove acceptable to a
large number of our Membcrs. Mr. O'Callaghan’s notes abeund 111 curious
and valuable matter, 111111 contain references to all the original sources of the
history of that period ; and the text will place in juxta-position two narratives

military command, the one under King James IL, 11011 the other under ΚίῐιμΓ

passages not found in the English, as 1111010111»)Υ that Socicty. We are in-

nity College, whose zealous and cnlightened support of every society having for
its object the promotion of learning 111111 1110 wclfare of Ireland will long, we
trust, cause his memory to be revercd amongst us. The circumstances under
which Professor Mac Cullagh became possessed of the Latin MS„ and the
motives which induced him 10 present it 10 1110 Secretary for pul:›licati011 by
this Soeiety, will be spoken ofin the prefaee to the work. It will he accom-
panied by an English version from a very correct MS„ written 011 the Conti-

about the same date, in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. The English
copies, however, often 011111 paragraphs and sentences that occur in the Latrim
