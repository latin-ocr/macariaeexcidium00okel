to pay the more punctually, for the future.⁷’ On
which, the Doctor observes :—“ This canon was
certainly a plentiful sweeping comnientary, in ἣν
vour of the clergy, on the third of the Synod of
Cashel.’' — (Lanigan's Ecclesiastical History of
Ireland, vol. iv. pp. 257-258, 26—1-271‚ 274.)

⁵ Dr. Keating, in the preface to his History of
heland, gives an explanation of the reasons for the
punishment of murder by an eric, or fine, rather
than by death, in ancient Ireland, according to
which explanation, the former system would seem to
have been the best that could have been adopted,
to deter from such a crime, under the existing cir-
cumstances of the country. For, in a country, di-
vided as Ireland was, into so many iudependent
and hostile communities, a person, who might corn-
mit a murder in one, could easily place himself out
of the reach of capital punishment, by taking refuge
in another. To execnte, in his stead‚any ofhisrela-
tives, innocent of such acrium, would be but to add
one murder to another; and, therefore, the most
likely way that remained, of preventing such a
crime, or the connivance at it, wasy to impose an
eric or fine, on the relatives of the person who
should be guilty3 to which penalty, as it appears
by the fifth deci-ee of this Council at Cashel, the
clerical as well as the lay relatives of such a crimi-
nal had been equally subjected; but, from defray-
ing their share of which, this fifth decree was, for
the future, to free the clericalrelatives, on the plea
of their being innocent of such an offeme, while the
lay relatives, though equally innocent, would thus

be worse off than before, in having the payment of
the whole eric thrown upon them.

ln reference ¹¹ to the decree of this synod, above-
mentioned, exempting lauds and other property of
the Church from all impositions exacted by the
laity,'' and to the other decree, “ relieviug the
clergy from any share iu the eric, or blood-fine,
which the kindred of a. Iayman, convicted of homi-
cide, were compelles] to pay among them to the
family of the slain‚'' Mr. Moore observes, that
‘⁶ the extension of such favours and immunities to
the Church, though by no means in accordance with
Henry’s general policy, appeared to him an expe-
dient necessary to be adopted in Ireland, where the
support of a strong party among the natives was
iudispensable towards the establishment of his
power.” Mr. Moore then alludes to the clergy, as
being, for this object on Henry's part, “the most
useful and legitimate instruments he could employ ;’'
adding, that, ⁶* from the same motive, doubtless,
the payment of tithes, which the Irish had never,
during their unreformed state, observed, was now
enjoined by Henry's council‚ with the hope, that
they would serve as a lasting bribe to the Church.’'
Could the design of making so many grants to the
clergy, at the expense of the laity, of Ireland, have
had any connexion with the circumstance of our
not finding any of the Irish laity present at this, as
they were at preceding, Synods ?-(Keating’s His-
tory of heland, preface, pp. [xxxin-lxxxvii. : Hal-
liday’s translatfflu-Moore's History of heland,
