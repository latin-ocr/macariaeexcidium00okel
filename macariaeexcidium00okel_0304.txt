been so successful in his endeavours, to persuade the Irish of his having come amongst them
rather as a redresser of grievances than a foreign invader, that the inhabitants ofthe districts
through which he marched, induced by his friendly conduct, and their earnest desire of ob-
taining that relief from the numerous evils of internal anarchy and bloodshed which only a

Roderic or Rory O'Conor was the son of Tordelvach or Turlogh O’Conor, King of Con-
naught, sirnamed More or the Greut, who, as the most powersul Prince in Ireland for several
years, was considered to have had the best claim to the designation of Monarch of Ireland.
Roderic, on his father's decease in 1156, succeeded to the crown of Connaught. But after a
war with Murtogh O’Laughlin‚ or Mac Laughlim of the Hy-Niall or ONeill racc, King of
Ulster, he was compelled to give him hostages‚ and acknowledge him as Monarch of Ireland;
till, on his death in l 166, the supreniacy‚ amongst the Irish Princes, reverted to the house of
O‘Conor. Henry's historiam, Cambrensis, having related the advance of the Anglo-Norman
King to Dublin, and mentioned the several Irish Prinees who attended on him as their
Sovereign, gives this account of Roderic's conduct, in reference to the summons sent him by
the invader to submit; and draws the following infierenoes, from that representation of the
matter. ‘⁵ Rothericus vero Connactiensis nunciis regiis, Hugoni scilicet de Lacy, et Gu-
