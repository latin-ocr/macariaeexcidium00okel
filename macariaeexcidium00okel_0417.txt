A contemporary Jacobite defence of the Earl of Tyrconnell‘s government in Ireland,
printed in 1688. says: ⁸· And for the Brittislz in Irelczud, they have not the least Reason to be
dejected, because they are sufficiently secure: Our Governor's Education, his Stake he has in
Englaml, his most Excellent, Charitnble, English Lady, himself desc-ended from a Famous
Ancient Stock ofEnglislz Nobility, TALEOT! ” Nevertheless, Mr. Hallam, speaking of the
Irish Viceroy 111 1687, eharacterizes him, as one who ‘⁴ loolied only to his mastvr's interests, in
subordination to those of his countrymen, and of his 0wn,'’ and observes,—” It, is now ascer-
tained, that, doubtful of the King’s success in the struggle sor restoring Popery in England, he
had made secret ovo-tures to some of the French agents for casting‘ off all connexion with that
kingdom, in case os James's death, and, with the ald of Louis, placing the crown ot' Ireland
on his own head. Mr. Mazure has brought this remarkable fact 10 light. B‹=11repoS‚ a

at Paris have been of this mind.” Finally‚ the royal Memoirs, 111 mentioning the divisions
amongst the Irish in 1691, or the last year os the war, during the siege of Athlone, allege,
that “ with the seditious petitions (which were at that time handed about the Army) and Bal-
