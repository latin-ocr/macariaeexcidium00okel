seconded with Dust, Smoke‚and all the Terrors that the Art of Man could invent, to ruin and
undo one another; and to make it the more uneasie‚ the Day it self was excessive hot to the
By-standers, and much more sure in all Respects to those upon Action. Captain Carlz'le, of
my Lord Droglzecla’s Regiment, run on with his Granadeers to the Counterscarp, and tho' he
received two Wounds between that and the Trenches, yet he went forwards, and commanded
his Men to throw in their Granades 3 but 1111110 leaping into the dry Ditch below the Counter-
scarp, an Irislmzan below shot him dead. Lieutenant Barlon however encouraged the Men,
and they got upon the Counterscarp‚ and all the Rcst of the Granadeers were as ready as they.
ssy this Timethe lrish were throwing down their Arms, and running as fast as they could into
Townt 3 which our Men perceiving, entred 1110 Breach pell-mell with them, and above Half the
Earl of Droglzeclds Granadeers, and some others, were actually in Town. The Regiments
that were to second the Granadeers went to the Counterscarp‚ and having no Orders to go
any further, there stopt. The Irislz were all running from the Walls, and quite over the
Bridge, into theEnglislz Town¹¹; but seeing but a Few of our Men enter, they were with much
ado persuaded to rally; and those that were in, seeing themselves not followed, and their
Ammunition being spent, they designed to retreat 3 but some were 51101, some taken, and the
Rest came out again, but very Few without being wounded. The Jrislz then ventured upon
the Breach again, and from the Walls, and every Place, 50 pester’d us upon the Counterscarp,
that after nigh three Hours resisting‚ Bullets, Stones, (broken Buttles, from the very lemen,
who holdly stood z'n tlte Breaclz, and were nearer 0ch- Men than their own) and whatever lVays
could be thought on to desti-oy us, our Ammunition being spent, it was judged safest to
return to our Trenches. When the work was at 1110 honest, the Bramlenhurglz Regiment
(who behaved themselves very well) were got upon the Black Ballcrgs, where the Enemies
Powder hapned to take Fire, and blew up a great Many of theus, the Men, Faggots, 8101105,
and what not, flying into the Air with a 111051 terrible Noise. Colone] Cults¹ was commanded
by the Duke of ll'yrtemberg to march towards the Spur at the 8011111 Gate‚ and beat in the
Iri-rhv that appeared there3 which he dm, tho' he lost several ofhis Meu, and was himself
wounded: For he went within half Musquet-shot of the Gate, and all his Men open to the
Enemies Shot, who lay secure within the Spur and the walls. The Danes were not idle all
this while, but fired upon the Enemy with all imaginable Fury, and had several kill'd; but the
Misehief was, we had but one Breach, and all towards the Lest it was impossible to get into the
Town when the Gates were shut, if there had been no Enemy to oppose us, without a great
many Scaling-Ladders, which we had not. From Half an Hour aster Three, till after Seven,
there was one continued Fire of both great and small Shot, without any Intermission3 inso-

¹² This sentence, so far, would appear to be a don last-cited, states of these Brandenburghers (or
very great exaggeration as regards the Irish, even Prussians) that “the Brandenburgh regiment lost
if the purport of it were not as much opposed to 400.’‘
