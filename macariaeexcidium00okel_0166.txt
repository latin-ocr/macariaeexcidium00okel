thero the Flower of their Army and Nation. The sensible Regrctt of
this publick Disaster, and 1110 dreadful Prospect of the unavoidable Con-
sequences of such a Defeat‚ filled all Cyprus with Grief and Dispaire;
and tho’ every Man’s particular Loss seemed to exhaust their whole
Stock of Teares, yet None was morc generally lamented than brave
Plcgsrrus,¹ for it was the Opinion of all People, if he had lived but an
Hour longer, the Cgspvians would be victorious that Day; and in case
110 were worsted‚ had he outlived the Defeat‚ noe Man would dispair,
but he would soon retricve it. Never was General better beloved by
any Army, and noe Captain was ever more fond of his SoldierS‚ than he.
It is admirable how such a strong Sympathie could be produced in soe
little a Time; for that was but the one and twentieth Day since 110 first
headed 1110 Army. But his innato Courage, the Affability of his Nature,

ac domestici dolores, quidquid lacrymarum supererat, absumpsisse viderentur,
Pyrrhus tamen prae omnibus, veris universae gentis fletibus complorabatur:
oninium enim animis ea invaluit opinio, si ad unam amplius horam superfuis-

virtute dedecus elueret. Numquam aut Dux exercitui, aut exercitus Duci,
charior suit. Stupendum sane qua occulta vi reciprocus ille effectus tam
exiguo tempore coaluerit: ad unum enim tunc et vicessimum tantsim diem
armorum regimen exercuerat3 sed egregia Viri virtus, facilis et omnibus pa-
