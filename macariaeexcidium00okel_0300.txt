the Anglo-Norman King as their Sovereign, and, as having done so, had sat in his Synod of
Cashel.

Such, at the period of the Anglo-Nomnan invasion, have been the representations given
of the very rude and demoralized state of the mass of the lrish people, which led to and faci-
litated that invasion, and of the ecclesiastical policy resorted to for their reformation‚ in
connexion with the Papal grant of the island to Henry ΙΙ, That‚ partly from the imperfec-
tion ofthe Irish national institutions‚ which were but too much calculated to occasion internal
feuds in the different septs, as well as war-s with their neighl)ourS,-pa1·tly owing to the want
of a sufficiently strong power in the supreme monarohy of the country, even in its best days,
to enforce a due obedience and tranquillity among the inferior states‚-partly, on account of
the horrible and demoralizing invasions of the Heathen Danes, by whose example, for above
200 years, in plundering and destroying churehes, monasteries, libraries, and ecclesiastics
over and over again, the nation was infected and debased,-partly‚ through the usurpation,
by Brian Boru, of the monarchy from the O'Neill race, its possessors for above five centu-
ries‚ which usurpation left the country, from the overthrow of the Danes to the coming of
the Anglo-Normans, or upwards of another century and a half, a prey to contentions sor the
supreme royalty‚ so that the monarchs of those days are designated, “ kings with reluctance
or opposition,''—that, under the ins-luence, for more than three centuries and a half, of such
powerful causes for national deterioration, Ireland should have been placed in a state so low in
point of civilization, as to render a very great moral, religious, and political reformation of
the mass of her people, at the period of Henry's landing, absolutely requisite, is a circum-
stance not to be wondered atu. Nevertloeless, that the rudeness and demoralization, instanoed

Bishop‚Lupus, i111012. See. likewise. the descrip-
tion, by william of Malnisbury, of the comparative
state of the Anglo-Saxons and Normans at, and sor
some time previous to, the Norman Conquest. The
English historian infers, from the very inferior
niorals‚ habits, &c.‚ of the Anglo-Saxons as a peo-
ple, that they required to be conquered and re-
formed by the Normans. Gibbon says. ofthis passage
of William of Malmsbury, that william “appre-

adds, as his own opinion upon this account of the
ecclesiastical writer, that ‘⁴ England was assuredly
a gainer hy the conquest.'’ Yet, while giving such
a bad account of the Anglo-Saxons, Malmsbury
concludes this character ofthem, with the following
reservation : ‘⁶ I would not, however, have these

bad propensities universally ascribed to the Eng-
lish. I know, that many of the clergy, at that day,

trod the path of sanctity by a blame-less life; 1
know, that many of the laity, of all ranks and condi-
tions, in this nation, were well-pleasing to God.
Be injustice far from this account3 the accusation
does not include the whole indiseriminately. ⁴ But,
as in peace, the mercy of God often cherishes the
bad and the good together3 so, equally, does his
severity include them both in captivity: ”.-(Doc-
