The circumstances of Lord Mountcashel's capture are thus related by the Enniskillen
annalist, the Rev. Andrew Hamilton: “ Lieutenant Genera] M'aclzarty, when his Men were
fied, he with about five or six Officers, went into a Wood near the Place where the Cannon were
planted; and some small Time after, came out of the Wood with those that were with him, on
Home-back, and fired his Pistol at the Party that were guarding the Cannon. Our Men, when
they came first from the Wood, thought then] some of 0111· own Party (supposing all the Enemy
fied), and never questioned them, till Illzzekarty tired his Pistol3 and then seven or eight of
the Soulsliers fired their Muskets at him, shot his Horse dead, and wounded him very ill in
several Places, and then to put him out of Pain, one of the Souldiers club'd his Musket to have
knock'd out his Brains, which one of those that came with him from the Wood, espying‚ called
to the Souldier to hold his Hand, for it was their General 11109- Carty ; at the Hearing of which
Captain Cooper came up, and gave Lieutenant-General Mac-Carty, and those that were with
him, Quat-ter, and that Night carried him to Newton-Butler,- and 119, being ask'd how he
came so rashly to hazard his Life, when he might have gone off with his Horse when they made
their Escape? profess'd that he found now the Kingdom like to be lost, his Army being the
best (for their Number) that King James had, unless those before Derry, who were then
much broken, and that he came with a Design to 1059 his Life, and was sorry that he miss'd
of 1115 End, being unwilling to outlive that Da-y''‘.

escape.

¹* King James‚'' says the Rev. Andrew Hamilt0n‚ “sent Mr. Haben, one of his Surgeons.
to InniskilHng, to attend Lieutenant General BIac-C'arty, and likewise sent him some Money
to subsist him and the other Officers who were taken Prisoners, and sent him some Hogsheads
of Wine, and other Provisions that were fit for 111111, which he could not get at Inniskilling.”

This kindness of 1115 Sovereign to Lord Mountcashel was the more necessary, as, in the
beginning of September, or about six weeks after his Lordship's capture at the battle of New-
ton-Butler, we are informed, that, in his delicate state, on account of the severe wounds he had
received, he found Enniskillen to be so unfavourable to his health‚ that he applied to Marshal
Schonberg for liberty, for some time, on parole, in order to get cured. ‘⁶ The Right Honour-
able my Lord Monntcashel, one of his Majesties Lieutenant-Generals,” says the Jacobite
pamphlet, ‘⁶ some time Prisoner of VVar, and very much indisposed by great and dangerous
Wounds, lying then at Iuiskilling (a Place most unwholsome in its Scituation) believing he had
