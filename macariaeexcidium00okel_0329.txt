near Coris, §c

Cartmight, Bishop of Chester, who accompanied King James to Iteland, says in his
jour‚nal as referred to by Dr. Charles Leslie: “On Thursday the l4th of M11rch,we came
to Cork and lodg'd at the Bishops Palaee, and I brought the Bishop and the Clergy to
the Kian g, who receiv'd them very kindly. Friday the 15th Ι went with the Bishop of
(furh to the King's Levee, and tarried at Court till 1 saw the Rebels of Banrlmz. at His Feet,
and the Mnister in an Elegant Speech begging their Pardon, which he granted them.''
The English copy of the royal journal observes : “ His Majesty was no sooner arrived at Cori<
than he caused an exact view to be taken of the place, and finding it in a reasonable good
condition, he gave orders for the strengthening the gam-ison, and the leaving some ammuni-
tion and fifty thousand livres there for the paying some small subsistence to the soldiers3 of
which there were a great many in that country. * * * * His Majesty having remained some
days at Cork, the Earl of Tyrconnell came thither to wait upon him3 and was immediately
created Duke, in recompence ofhis great services, and successful endeavours towards the
preservation of the kingdom of Ireland.’'

The following, according to the King, was the account given at Cork, by the Viceroy,
of the circumstances under which he had preserved Ireland. The Duke said, “that he had
sent down Lieftenant General Hamilton with about 2500 men, being as many as he could
spare from Dublin, to make head against the Rebels in Ulster, who were masters of all
that Province except Charlemont and Ca1·=·icferg·us; that most part of the Protestants in
other partes of the Kingdom had been up, that in Munster they had possessed themselves
of Castle Martir and Banden, but were forced to surrender both places and were totally
reduced in those parts by Lieftenant Genera] Macarty, and were in a manner totally suppress'd
in the other two provinces3 that the bare reputation of an army had done it, togather with
the diligenee of the Catholick Nobility and gentry, who had raised above fifty Regiments of
foot and several troops of hors, and Dragoons, that he had distribited amongst them about
20‚000 armes, but were most so old and unserviceable, that not aboue one thousand of the
fire arms were found afterwards to be of any use3 that the old troops consisting osone Bat-
talion of Guards, togather with Macartys, Clencartys, and Newton'sz Regiments, were pretty
well armed, as also seaven Companys of Mountjoys which were with them, the other six
haveing stayd in Derry with Coll: Lundy and Gus: Hamsston, the Lieftenant Coll: and Major
of that Regiment3 that he had three Regiments of Hors, Tyrconnell's‚ Russel's, and Galinoy's‚
and one of Dragoons; that the Catholicks of the Country had 110 arms whereas the Protes⁴
tants had great plenty, and the best horses in the Kingdom; that for artillery he had but
eight small field pieces in a condition to march, the rest not mountcd, no stores in the maga-

zines,
