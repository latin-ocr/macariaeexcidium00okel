The Villare Hibernicum supplies the followingr particulars (under different dates from
Story) as to the amount of William's army advancing upon Limerick, after thejunction of

1113111ἲί in the King's possession, but very far from such a regular fortification as those the

name of 3 forte1·eSS.'' Accordingly, “Lausum” says the Abbe Mac Geoghegan, ‘⁵ apres avoir
visite les fortifications cle Limeriek, dit, en jurant, que son Maitre prendroit cette place avec
des pommes cuitess' The Abbe adds, that, on the approach of the English, ‘¹ M. de Lauzun
