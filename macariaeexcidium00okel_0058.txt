was there in all the globe, not even Delphos itself, a spot where the
heavenly powers were more religiously adored, and the Delplzz'c rites more
sincerely celebrated, than in the island of Cyprus.

26. Now, when Eryces approached the shores of Cyprus with a mighty
host, levied in every quarter, rumour greatly magnified his numbers, and
the lesser Princes, intimidated, and more particularly afraid of opposing
theSonereiyn Pontiff, whom they venerated as a second Deity, made their
submission to him at Salamis. Rodiens, however, who was then Chief
King of the whole island, relying on the position and natural strength of
Paphia (over which he had been the toparch⁷ before he was called to the
supreme authority), and neither intimidated by Eryces's numerous host,
nor by the unjust bull of‘the Sovereign Pontiff (who he well knew was
a Ciliciam by birth), made vigorous preparations to assert by arms the
rights and liberties of his kingdom. But the sudden and unexpected
defection of some of the provincial Pririces, and the numbers that de-
ser-ted from the ranks of his followers, rendered it impossible sor him at
that tirno to expel the Cilicians from the island.

gionis reverentia maxime perculsi, si Arclnssaminis, quem secundum Deum
venerabantur, nutibus ac voluntati restitissent, Salamina, imperata facturi
conveniunt. At Rodien-s Insulae totius ea tempestate Moderator, Paphia] situ,
ubi nondum ad supremae Majestatis fastigium evectus imperitaverat, et muni-

Archz'flamz'm's mandato (quem patria Cilicem esse non ignorabat) consternatus, ad
defensanda regui jura et asserendam libertatem arma impigre sumpsit: impa-
rem tamen extrudendis tum ex Insula Cilicibus, tum attenuatae, desciscentibus
popularibus, copiae, tum subita et improvisa provincialium Regum defectio
effecerat.
