considered they had the Concerns of a Nation to look after, and suppose
the King (out ofafalse Maxim of State) were convinced that it was his
Interest to lett T lzeodore eonquer Cyprus, in Hope it might facilitate his
own Restoration to Cilicia, it would be a great Hardship on the Cypodans
to sacrifice theire LiveS, theireEstates and F ortunes, the Religion of their
Aneestors‚ and all that was dear to them in this World, out of a vain
Presumption that by theire Ruin Amasis [would be] reinthroned in
Cilicia, whilst they and theire Posterity should be reduced to an inevi-
table Necessity ofendureing a perpetuall Bondage? or, rather, to be
extirpated‚ Root and Braneh‘? for that was known to have been alwayes
the Design and Result of the Cilic-iaus. They held themselves, therefore,
oblidged by the indispensable Law of Nature, Honour, and Conscience‚
to take other Methods, as well for their own as for the Preservation of
those who employed and entrusted them, by giveing to both Kings a
truc Account of the present State of Cyprus, of the Nation's unalterable
Resolution to hold out to the Last; and how easie it was to recover the
whole Island from Theodoro, or at least to keep him soe employed there,

rum acerbitate insectarentur, cum sibi Regi per omnia satisfecisset. Quasi
vero solae Amasis utilitates et commoda nationi illi obversari debuissent; et
cuni illi przepostere falsoque documento persuasum esset, se propensioribus
subditorum animis in avitum Cilicia? regnum restaurandum iri, si Theodorus
in Cypro debellasset, ideone Cypriis susdeque esse oportebat, Vitam, bona, sor-
tunas, majorum religionem, et quidquid denique aut sanctum aut charum
hominibus est, ex inani et male fundat& opinione suo exitio Amasim in amis-
sum Cilicia> solum postliminio recipiendum, dum interim sibi posterisque
aeternae servitutis mala necessario siut subeunda? imo, dum se funditus era-
dicandos, et e medio tollendos non ignorarent, quod pervicacibus Cilices odiis
jamdudum agitasse liquebat: inevitabili certe naturae lege tenebantur nihil
inexpertum relinquere, quo saluti et incolumitati suae prospicerent: et si Le-
gati, ut aliud quidquam agerent, adduci potuissent, summa perfidia conceptam
de se gentis universae expectationem fefellissent. Non immerito igitur con-
jectare licet, eos suo non defuisse officio, et quo in statu res Cypri reliquissent
ambobus coram Regibus haud perfunctoria narratione exposuisse: totam na-
tionem in eo esse, ut extrema omnia pro Patria non recusent ς quamque arduum
