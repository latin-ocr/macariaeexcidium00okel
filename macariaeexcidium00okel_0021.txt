consider it most likely, that the Latin version of Colone] O⁷Kelly⁷s
work originated.

As the sslaearioe Eoeeidz'um, in its present enlarged or Latin and
English shape, may be considered to include a sort of outline of the
history of Ireland, from the 'earliest times to the end of the VVar of
the Revolution, the Editor hopes that circumstance, together with the
frequent necessity for double evidence, or extracts from the writers
of both sides relative to the many controverted topics occurring in the
text, will tend to excuse the length to which his department of the
work has run. This length he the more regrets, since it has swelled
the volume to a size, which makes it requisite that the narrative by
Monsieur Dumont, an officer in Marshal Schonberg's Regiment os
Horse, during the campaigns of 1689 and 1690 in Ireland, should be
deferred to a future occasion, for publication. But, since the Hugue-
not Officer's narrative does 7205 embrace the concluding campaign of
1691, it was thought better to print Colone] O'Kelly‘s work, extend-
ing to the end of the war as it does, and proportionably annotated as it
has been, than that such a work should be less sully illustrated, merely
to malive room for the Williamite narrative, in the same volume.

With regard to other matters, the Editor would wish to correct
here an error into which he was led at Note 142, p. 362, by stating,
from an English publication, the day and year of the Duchess of Tyr-
connell⁷s death in Dublin, as March 1 cath, 17 3¹ 3 the real period of that
Lady's decease being mentioned, on better authority, as March 6th,
1730‘2‘. In Note 64, p. 254, also, the Editor's observation as to the
three Bulls of Pope Alexander III.⁷ pp. 255-262, and pp. 501-504, not
having been employed by Irish historiam to illustrate the important
event with which those documents are so prominently connected, was
written when such was literally the case, although they have been
