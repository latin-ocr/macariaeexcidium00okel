which were appointed several Officers, viz. six Commissioners divided into two classes, the first
and second, four Comptrolkws, two Sem-marias, one for each claSS, two lVarders, one Trea-
surer, four tellers, four feeders, eight laben-ers at the fly, two portel-s, a messenger, a stoi-e·-
keeper, and two door-keepers. Eaeh set of men were obliged to work at each press twelve
hours night and day, wheresore a double set of hands was required. The Commissioners in
Dublin were John Trinder, Thomas Goddard, William Talbot, William Brumfield, Francis
Rice, and Edward Fox, Esqrs. ; and Walter Plunket‚ at Limerick. The Secretaries, Mr. John
Tringer, and Mr. Samuel Clark, Mr. Hewlet, Treasurer, Messrs. Holland. Morgan, Usborn,
and Dempsey, Comptrollers. This settled, they went to work, and King· James, on the eigh-
teenth of June, issued a Proclamation for making two sorts of money, of hrass and copper
mixed-metal, current in this Kingdom. The one for twelve, and the other for six penee.'’

Colonel O'Kelly, in supposing King James's mint was not set 10 work till the sixth
month, Ο. S„ or August, 1689, is wrong, as appears by the following passage from Snelling's
supplement to Simon‘s work z ¹⁶ The gun' money of James the Second, we think commenced
with the six pence, as it is the only piece with June 1689 on it, the other months found on
them are July. Aug. Sept. 7 ber. Nov. Dec. Jan. and Feb. Of the shillings there are of
every month from July 1689 to June 1690, and one of September 1690.”

This last piece would seem to have heen coined at the mint in Lhnerick, since from the
battle of the Boyne, in the previous July, Dublin was in William‘s possessiom Limorick hence-
forwzwd, or till the end of the war, in the autumn of 1691, was the Jacohite metropolis of
Ireland; and we know, moreover, from Eishop Nioolson, that, within this last period, money
was coined there. The dates of other pieces mentioned by Snelling, besides those above stated,
would also show Colonel O'Kelly to be wrong, in having assigned August as the month. in
which the coinage of the brass money begam.
