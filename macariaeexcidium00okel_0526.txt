and children on doparting for France, the following paragraph from a contemporary Anglo-
lrish or Williamite newspaper, called “ lee Dublz'n Inlelligencess'

‘¹ Barbarous and inhuman hath been Waltop's Usage to-the poor Irish, which lately were
shipped from Kerry. He, finding while they lay encamped (waiting for transport Ships) that
they began to desert him upon Account of the ill Condition of their Wives and‘Families in
this Kingd0m‚ promised to take them also with him; and a Declaration to that Effect having
been issued by Sarsfield and Walzop, they accordingly were brought to the Water Side, when
Walzop, pretending to ship the Soldiers in Order, according to his Lists of them, first carried
the Men on Board; many of the WVomen, on the second Return of the Boats for the Officers,
catching Hold to be carried on Board, were dragged off with the Boats, and through Fearful-
ness loosing their Hold were drowned; others who held faster had their Fingers cut off, and
came to the same miserable End, in the Sight of their Husbands and Relations.''

Story, with such a Williamite account evidently before him, writes, under the head of ‘⁶ The
lrish severely dealt withal at their E171I1arqm'ng‚” to a similar effect.

‘⁶ A great Many of them having Wives and Children, they made what Shift they cou'd to
desert, rather than leave their Families behind to starve, which my Lord Lucan and Major
General Wuuglzop perceiving‚ they Publish a Declaration, ΤΙιαΙ ιω· Almus qflhe Iro-h as had
α Minci to ’t‚ should hat-e Liberty to Transport their Families along with. themselves. And
accordingly a vast Rabble of all Sorts were brought to the Water-side, when the Major Gene-
ral, pretending to Ship the Souldiers in Order, according to their Lists‚ they first carried all
the Men ou Board, and many of the VVomen, at the second Return os the Boat for the Offi-
cers, catching hold to bc carried on Board, were [lragged off, and through Fearfulness, losing
their Hold, were drowned; but others who held faster had their Fingers cut off, and so perished
in Sight of their Husbands, or Relations, tho* those of them that did get over wou‘d make but
a sad Figure, if they were admitted to go to the late Queen‘s Court at St.Germa1'7ze.”

Nevertheless, in other Williamite accounts, “women and children'' are related to have
accompanied the Irish military who went to France, as well in the French fleet, which con-
veyed those who first sailed for that country, from the Shann0n3 as in the ships under Sars-
field, Lord Lucan, that brought away those who went off the last, from Corki.

A paragraph, headed “ Paris, Decemh. 14.'' in the London Gazette, No. 2722, says, ‘⁴ The
Squadron commanded by the Sieur (Ie Chasteau Renaud, anchored in the Road of Brest the

3d of this Month. 'Tis said, that about lO‚000 Irish are in all arrived there, including Women
and Children.”

A paragraph, headed “Falmoutlz, Decemb. 26.” in the London Gazette, No. 2727, ob-
serves: “ On the 24th instant put in here Three Transport Ships with 400 Irish bound for
Brest: they came from Corke on the 22nd, in Company of 8 or 9 Ships more, from whom they

were separated in bad Weather; they took on Board in all about 2000 Irish‚ reckoning Women

and Children.”
A paragraph,

'¹ Compare the fact, of this embarkation having of The Dublin Intelliyence‚ as to the embarkation
taken place from Cork, with the previous assertion having been from Kerry.
