“the Irish were never known to fight with more Resolution‚'' observeS, ‘⁶ especially their

The contemporary Huguenot or Williamite Mercure, referring to the relations given of
the behaviour of the Irish army in general at Aughrim‚ likewise alludes, more particularly, to
the gallantry which the infantry were mentioned to have displayed ε “ On leur rend,'' it says,
‘⁸ ce ffimoignage, qu'ils se battirent en gens de coeur, δε que leur infanterie sur tout fit des mer-
veilles.''

The famous Chevalier Charles Wogan, nephew of the Duke of Tyrconnell, noticing, in
1734, the conduct of his countrymen in this engagement, adverts to it as one which, ‘⁴ till the
sudden fall of their General (St. Ruth), was fought with more bravery on their side, than any
battle had been, perhaps, for some centuries past, by any people, under equal disadva11tages”f.

The particulam supplied by the Williamite Chaplain‚ Story, as to the time during which
the battle of Aughrim lasted, are the following. He states, in reference to the first approach
of Ginkell against the Irish position, which was by his left wing, and opposite their right

the Williamite “ Army stood still till ntjglz 12 α C'lock,'' when they “ were Commanded to Ad-
vance, the General going with a Party before to view the Enemy, and perceiving some of their
out Scouts upon the Hills, ordered a Party to beat them from thence‚‘’ Sco. Story goes on to
describe some of the VVilliamite cavalry movements with an out-post of Danes, and part of
Conyngham's Dragoons, against Urrachree, while the main army continued to march forwards,
by which time, he says, ‘¹ it was Two α ΟΖοσΙι.” He proceeds with the continuatim] of Gin-
kell's cavalry movements against the Irish in the same directim, by part of Conyngham's
Dragoons, by Eppinger’s DragoonS‚ and the greater portion of the Earl of Portland's Horse
Guards3 which movements are described as terminating “ after about an hom-'s dzkputess’ or, in
other words, about three v’cloek. He next informs us, how, as “ all Things seemed pretty quiet
for a while,'’ the Williamite ‘⁶ General Officers coming together, began to consult whether it
was fit to give the Enemy Battel that Night‚” διε. Of this consultation, he gives us to under-
stand, that it lasted till ‘⁴ about Half cm Ηυιιν pasc Fow· in the Afternoon‚'' when, he says,
still speaking in reference to the Urrachree side, ‘⁶ a Part of our Left &Ving moved towards
the Enemy, and by Five the Battel began a fresh,''—occasioning‚ amongst the hedges lined by
the Irish infantry, “great Firing on both Sides‚·‘ that “ continued on the Left niglz an Hour
