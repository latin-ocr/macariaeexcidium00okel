of the near approach of Christmas ; but I hope my letter will be received as an
evidence of my good wishes for the Irish Archaeological Soeiety, and that the

the Society nearly at the 5111110 111110, although the noble donor was not at all
aware 111111 110 had been antieipated by the example of Mr. Reeves. Our excel—
lent Vice-President, 1110 Mai-quis of Kildare, has proposed to print, at his own
expense, in a form eorresponding with the publications of the 50010111, a.
0011005 inventory of the lauded property, (εξ-00115, and 0111111015 of Gcrald Fitz-
gerald, Earl of Kildare, in 1518. The manuscript from which the N oble
BIarquis proposes 10 print this volume 15 preserved in the Eritish Museum,
and an accurate transcript of it, prepared for 1110 111055 at the expense of 1110.

interesting 10 1110 autiquary, and illustrative of 1110 domestic manners of the

inventories of 1115 plate, and ‘ The obyts ofDiveree Lordys and Gentyllmen of
the Geraldes.’

“ These liberal and publie-spirited donations will be of essential serviee 10

publications until this debt could be recovered.

‘⁶ The Couneil would, therefore, beg leave to suggest that the marked and
most grateful thanks of the Soeiety be voted to the Rev. William Reeves and
