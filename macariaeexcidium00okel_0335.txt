James, νεῖαι-πίῃς from Derry to Dublin, assembles the Irislz Pm-liament there. llis reasons

The King‚ on the 25th of March, the day after his arrival in Dublin, summoned the Irish
Parliament to meet on the 7th of May, ‘⁶ atin‚'' says the Duke of Berwick, “ de trouver les
fonds pour la guerre? When, also, according to the Jacobitejournal, “the King consulted
with his General Officers at Dublin about the siege of Dei-ry in case Coleraine should be.
taken„ it was proposed to prepare store of tools and other things necessary sor ιι siege* Upon
which his Majesty caused his magazines to be looked into. But. instead of finding things
necessary, as he expected, he was informed by the Earl os Melforn who had visited the said
magazines by his order, that there was nothing at all of what was required, nor even anything
that looked like a magazine‚'' διο. After the overthrow of the. last Williamite force that at-
tempted to cover Derry on the l5th of April, the same authority mentions, that “his Ma-

for the defending of Derry, and seeing the necessity there was, to provide things necessary

lead to its surrender, the King acted (though without success) on that representation, the
royal Memoirs allege of his Majesty‚ and of his two Officers, De Rosen and de Lery,-“ at a
Council of War, it was resolved they should go back to Dublin to prepare all things for the
Parliament's niceting‚ and to hasten more troops to reinforce the army there‘'—that is, at
Derry. And, according to the royal journal, the King‘s return to Dublin, for the pur-
pose of pushing forward the military preparations, was the more requisite, since, upon his
return there, on the 26th of April, he found “the arins not arrived from Cork, ffinsale, or
Waterford;'' that “ in the arsenal nothing had been done for preparing of tools, which
obliged him to renew his orders on those two heads ;'' and, as to the “ new levies,” that “those
new levies, when Iooked inm, were found to be only regimeuts in name, and uotfiwmed υ)-
fitfor service.·‘ To these weighty reasons, as well as others, for the royal presence. in Dub-
lin, if we add the important circumstance of the Repeal of the Act of Settlement, and the pre-
paration of the Act of Attaiuder, to affect such a large portion of the landed property of the
kingdom, being then in contemplation, and respecting which the King should be with his Law
