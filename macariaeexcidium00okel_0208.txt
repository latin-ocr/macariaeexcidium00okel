which, since the sixteenth century, has finally prevailed over other systems in Scotland,
was or was not such as had been originally established in North Britain by the Irish mission-
aries or Culdees, who converted the Picts from Heathenism, it would be here unseasonable to
inquire. It may be more interesting to add, from a learned Seotch writer, a circumstance
hitherto not sufficieutly noted, as to the great length of time, during which the clergy of
Scotland continued to be Irishmen. ‘⁵ The Culdees,” says that writer, Keith, ⁵⁴ were, appa-
rently, from Columba's time to the twelsth century, the only monks and clergy in Scotiand,
ancl ALL Irislz ...... At St. Andrew's they elected the Bishops till 1140, and existed there
till 1297 ...... At Dunkeld, Dumblane, and Breckin‚ they elected the Bishops yet later
than at St, Andrews. At the two last they constituted, with their prior, the dean and chapter,
till about 1240. To a late period the only common clergy in Pickland [i. e. Pictland] were
Jrz'sh. When the church of St. Andrew was made metropolitan by Kings Achy and Grig,
at the end of the ninth century, it was long before a native clergy could be formed3 and the
Irish clergy, from superior opportunities and learning, and from ancient veneration and cus-
tom, still held the common offices of the Church, even down to the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. Interest, national spIrit, and ecclesiastic party, long maintained them, and they
were only supplanted by degrees, as the natives, from advanced society, and visiting foreign
universities‚ began to acquire learning.’'

Along with this testimony of Keith, it may be mentioned, that in those portions of Scotland,
or the Highlauds and Western lsles, where the ancient or Celtic language and the Roman
Catholic religion maintained themselves against the inroads of more recently introduced forms
of speech and doctrine, the native Scots, down to a much later period, appear to have owed
whatever spiritual instruction they received to priests from lreland. King James 11„ in that
part of his advice to his son, written in 1692, respecting the conduct which the latter should
observe towards Scotland, in case of his gaining the crowns ofhis ancestors, says: “ As to the
Highlands, send and encourage missionairs amongst them, and establish scholes there, that
they may haue of their own country men to be their Pasturs, and not lae behfolding only to the
Irislz for to be supplyd with Preists''³. To remedy which want ofa native Roman Catholic clergy

in those parts of Scothand, the King bids his son “make some settlement on the Scots College

³ *⁴ His Majesty,'' says a Seotch writer, of King
George 1V., ‘⁶ on visiting Scotland, through Mr.
Peel, with great cordiality, became Patron of the
Society sor the Support ofGaelic Schools, and, since
that period, the Society for Propagating Christian
Knowledge and the General Assembly have cor-
dially taken up the same idea ..... Το these Gaelic
schools have resorted not only the child of tender
years, but the old man and old woman stooping for
age. Never, since education was promoted by any
body of men, was it found necessary to supply assis-
tance to the eyes themselves: yet such has been the

engerness of certain aged scholars in the Highlands,
that, within these two years, in order to meet it,
the Gaelic School Society have had placed at their
disposal not fewer than 120 pairs of spectacles¹ But
1 must not enlarge, and shall simply advert to one
school in the Hebrides, where 237 scholars were
present at the examination, ofall ages, from lite-
rally a great-great-grandmother down to the child
offive years.’' On the eagerness of these descen-
dants of the ancient Irish to Iearn, when taught in
their native tongue, it is remarked: ‘⁴ There would
seem to be afascination in these Celtic dialects pe-
