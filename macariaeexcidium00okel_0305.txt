eisdem. Quinque portiones in anum redigentur”—meaning, that thefive old native kingdoms of
Leinster, Ulster, Connaught, Minister, and Meath, were swallowed up in the siztlz kingdom,
or that of ALL Ireland, so assumed to have been acquired by Hem-y.

Dr. Leland, in opposition to this account of Rodcric‘s conduct towards Henry by the
Welsh writer, represents Roderic acting. as if “ his fortune was not yet so totally desperate
as to warrant an immediate resignation of his dignity and authority, while his own territory
(Connaught) remained inviolate, and the brave and powerful chiefs of Ulster kept retIred in
their own districts, without any thought of submission''¹'. The Doctor thus controverts, on
lrish as well as English authority, the alleged fact of Roderic‘s having ever made any such
submission to Henry’s envoys, Hugh de Lacy and William Fitz-Aldelm, as that mentioned
by Cambrensis. “ The Irisli annalists acknowledge no such submission, and the Abbot of
Peterhorough declares ingenuously‚ that the King of Connaught still continued to maintain
his independence; agreeing in this with the artless historical strictures of Ireland, which
distinctly mark the extent of Henry's present acquisitions, without the least appearance
of disguise or partiality, and represent their Monarch as still exercising an independent sove-
reignty, opposing the invaders, and at length treatmg with Henry, at the time, and in the
manner7 stated on record.'' In other words, about four years afterwards, or in 1175, by his
ambassadors, with the Anglo-Norman King at VVindsor; on which occasion he acted not
merely as King of Connaught, but as Monarch, under Henry, over all Ircland, with the
exception of the small portion occupied by the Anglo-Norman settlers, which was allowed to
be under the miminis-tration of the Viceroy of Henry.

Dr. Leland's representation of Roderic's conduct with reference to Henry, while the latter
was in Ireland, is justified by the general testimony of other Anglo-Norman contemporary
chroniclers as well as Benedict‚ viz.³ by that of Hoveden, Dieeto, and Gervase. Among these
authorities, there is no mention whatever made of any ternis of submission having either
emanated from, or been agreed t0‚ by Roderic; but, on the contrary, we find him affirming,
and persisting, that he himself was the rightful Monarch of lreland, and, as such, refusing to
acknowlcdge or wait upon chry; who is stated to have consequently resolved on attacking
Roderic the next summer, (that of 1172) and completing the reduction of the island3 but to
have been prevented from doing 50, by being unfortunately obliged to depart for England and
the Continent, in the spring. The application, under such circumstances, by Cambrensis, of
the prophecy, “Saccus Hiberniae maenia subue1·tet,'' to Henry's expedition to this country,
is censured by King James l.'s Attorney-General sor Ircland, Sir John Davies. Considering
that prediction as, in every sense, morejustly applicable to his royal master, who, before he
asceuded the English throne, and became the first universally-aeknowledged British Sovereign
of 1reland, was James the Sioetlc of Scotland, Sir John says of the prophecy--‘⁴ which is per-

formed,

¹³ In mentioning De Courcy’s expedition against dom, as “Vltoniam‚ armis Anglorum, hactenus
Ulster in 1177, Cambrensis speaks of that king· iucognitam.'’-(Hibr Expug„ lib. ii. cap. 16.)
