stances, connected him (as has been previously noted) with much knowledge of the events of
this war, observes : “ This battle was certainly a bloody and docisive one. The stake was
great, the Irish knew the value os it, and though very inferior to their enemies in numbers and
appointmentS, and chagrined by repeatedlosses, yet it must be owned, that they foughtitwell.

flushed opponents, snatched from them that victory, which already began to declare in their
favour. Their bones,“ he concludes, “ yet lie seattered over the plains of Aughrim ; but let
thatjustice be done to their memories‚ which a brave and generous enemy never refuses''¹¹'.

the troops dispersed in the mountains and bogs, there had been no possibility of houlding out
before a victorious Army ; but by the enemies turning their march towards Galway, they gaue
the Irish time to reassemble their seaterd forces and delay their destiny some months longer'' .
