were infantry, and 3660 cavalry. King James's fleet (the exact numerical details of which
cannot be gathered from his Memoirs) is stated by Dalrymple to have consisted of sixty-one
ships, of which thirty-eight were of the line; and the King rates his army (without counting
militia), at 4o‚‹)00 rnen 3 ‘⁶ which force‚'' add the royal Mmmirs, “ his Majesty thought suffi-
cient to deal with the Prince of Orange, either by sea or land, and had realy been so, had
the officers been faithfull.’'

As regards one portion of this observation, it appears from the Freneh naval historian,
Sue, ‘⁴ que la flotte du Prince d'Orange etait tellement encombree de soldats et de munitions,
que les batimens d'escorte etaient en si mauvais etat, qu‘une escadre de vingt vaissaux de
guerre anraient facilement disperse cette multitude de navires marehant presque sans ordre,
et port(¹ un coup morte] a la puissance maritime de la Hollande.'' As regards the other por-
tion of the King's observation, the very superior amount of his land forces to those of the
Dutch leaves no room for questioning the justice of his assertion, on that head. An Irish
Protestant officer, Captain Robert Pax-ker, of the Earl of Meath‘s, afterwards the Royal Irish,
Regiment of Foot, who was then in England, and who, on account of some losses the Dutch
land-force had suffered by the time it had reached England, makes its numbers ‘⁶ not fully
l4,000,” says in his Memoirs :—‘⁴ Here it is to be observem, to the honour of the army, that it
was they,in a great measure, who saved the nation, at thisjuncture. They, seeing their re-
ligion, laws, and liberties at stake, refused to fight for their King, because he had overturned
the Constitution3 and declared in favour of the Prince, who came to restore it, else it had not
been possible for him, with the handful of men he brought over (not full l4‚000), to have
compleated our late glorious Revolution; the conseque-noes of which, not Grent Britain only
in particular, but also Europe in general, is very sensible of at this day‘'¹¹.

The King finding, that (to use the language of his Memoirs) ‘¹ now things were come to
that extremity, by the generali defection of the nobility‚ geutry, and clergie, by the scandalous
desertion of the chief officere and others in the army, as gaue little reason to trust those who
remaiu'd, so that no other councel could reasonably be embraced, but to quit the kingdom
