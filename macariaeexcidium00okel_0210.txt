Ροριιῖιιι· accusativus in Englancl and Scotltzml against Clzarles Ι.. osbeing ill-affected to Pro-
testantism, and the King's clefence.

The insurrection in Great Britain, against Charles 1.‚ which, after beginning in Scothznd,
extended to Englandv, was much advanced by the reports circulated, of the danger that
menaced the Protestant religion from the advances of Popery, and the King's regard for
Papists. This latter circumstance is thus explained by Dr. KVelwood in his Memoirs:--“ The
King's urgent necessities, and the backwardness of the Parliament to supply them, had forced
him upon unwarrantable methods of raising money ; and the readiness the Roman Catholicks
express'd to assist him in his wants, did beget in him at first a tenderness towards them, and
afterwards a trust and confidence in them : which was unhappily mistaken by his other sub-
jects, as if he inclin'd to their religion.''

Charles's defence of himself, against the notion of his having had a leaning towards the
Roman Catholic saith, is thus set f01·th‚inl1is “Declaration to all his loving Subjects, published
with the Advice of his Privy-Council,'' in 1641 :—“ Concerning religion, as there maybe any
suspicion of favour or inclination to the Papists, we are willing to declare to all the world,
that as we have been from our childhood brought up in, and practised the religion now
established in this kingdom, so it is well known, we have (not contented simply with the prin-
ciples of our education) given a good proportion of our time and pains to the examination of
the grounds of this religion, as it is different from that of Rome& and are from our soul so
fully satisfied and assured‚ that it is the most pure and agreeable to the sacred Word of God,
of any religion now practised in the Christian world 3 that as we believe we can maintain the
same by unanswerable reasons, so we hope we should remlily seul ie hythe (ffitsion ofom·
blood, {f z‘t pleasecl God to call us to that sacrg'ficew. And, therefore, nothing can be so

acceptable

' “ Notwithstandim¹ all the groundless clamem-s
of some, who loudly cry out against the Irish,'' says
Lord Castlehaven, ‘⁴ bnt speak not a word of their
own rebellion, Ι must do that kingdom so much jus-
tice, as to dec-lare, that Ι can no more believe, the
leading part of the nati0n‚ did ever design, much
less encourage, the barbarous cruelties there coni-
mitted, than Ι can be persuaded, that the Lords
and Commons, who first made war against the late
King,'' Charles Ι.. “in England, did from the be-
ginning intend to imbrue their hands in his sacred
blood. Yet still I think thern inexcusable, because
1 see no great diffierence, whether a man kills ano-
ther himself, or unchains a fierce mastiff, that will

tear him to pieces. Ι cannot therefore but believe,
the contrivers and abettors of the Irish rebellion,
guilty of the massacre that ensued, tho' committed
by the rude rabble; no less than those that raised
the late rebellion in England, as guilty of their
Prince's blood, as if they had actually been regi-
cides: tho* the army on the one hand, and the rab-
ble on the other, did the work, which their first
movers, who unchained them from their obedienoe
to the laws, were not able to hinder.''— (Memoirs,
pp. 16-18.)
