That the expectation of “ quartering in Dublin'' before the end of the campaign, above
alluded to in the Jacobite account, did really exist amongst Μαι-51101 Schonberg's officers, on
their landing at Carrickfergus, in August, 1689, 15 certain. Lord Lisburn, colom-1 of a
Regiment of Foot in the Marshal's army, in an unpublished letter to the Earl of Slii·ewsl)ury,
copied by the writer of this note in the State Paper Office, London‚ and dated. from the
Camp at Dundalk, September thh, 1689, says: “ Our Generalh the most active & vigi-

forces could take the field appears to have been, that the Marshal was abundantly supplied by
sea from England with evei-y requisito for putting his men and horses in motion, while the
lrish were very differently circumstanced. In the abstraots, given in Mr. Thorpe's Cata-
logue for 1836, of the correspondence between the Duke of Tyrconnell and Mai-y of Este,
Queen of James ΙΙ.. from October, 1689, to June, 1690, we find mention of“letters relating
to large fleets passing (laily with provisions. arms, and ammunition for the Duke of 30110111-

rence to the condition ofthe Irish, or “ the apprehensions of King James’s party,'' numerous
“letters relate the want of stores for their horses. so dreadful that they cannot move until

the grass grow to strengthen their horses, or gain a supply from elsewhere''². Y
