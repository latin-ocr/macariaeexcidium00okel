be made good after the coming of the Frenclz Fleet : And first it was but reasonable, seeing
it was within the Intent of the Articles. Second1y‚ z‘t was Prudence not to deny it, since the
Frenclz Fleet being Eighteen Men of War, Four Fireships‚ and Twenty Ships of Burden, were
certainly too lzardfor Captaz'n Coal [md his Squndron then in the Slzcznnon, and might have put
what Men and Provisions they pleased into the English Town, our Army also being gone to
Quarters, we had only Five Regiments in the Irish Town, with my Lord Droglzeda's, and my
Lord Lisburu's, Encamp'd without the Walls. Provismns also were so παῖ-σε with us, that
our Men had only α Pz‘nt of Meal a Day allowed them, and the lrish in the other Town were

By this assertffin, Colonel O'Kelly appears to have judged the Treaty of Limerick rather
from the unfortunate results of its violation as regards the religious freedom of the lrish
Roman Catholics, than from what the very first ofthe Civil Articles sets forth in their favour
on that head, and from the statements, in the second and ninth of the same Articles‚ respecting
the Oath of Allegianee, by which it was stipulated (as if to guard against the introduction of
any such eztra Oaths as were afterwards introduced) that such Oath,“and Νο other‚'‘ was to be
administered to the lrish Roman Catholies submitting to King William's and Queen Mary's
government, or the new order of things established by the Revolution.

The words of the first of the Civil Articles referred to are: ‘⁴ The Roman Catholicks of
this kingdom, shall enjoy such Privileges in the Exereise of their Religion, as are consistent
with the Laws of lreband; or as they did enjoy in the Reign of King Chai-les the 113 And their
hlajesties, as soon as their Affairs will permit them to Snnnnon a Parliament in this Kingdom,
will endeavour to procare tlte said Roman Catholiclcs vsut-li further Security in that Particular,
us may preserve them from any Disturbance upon the tlt-count of their said Helzgz‘on.''

The second of those Civil Articles guaranteeing the possession ostheir estates, &c., and
the exercise of their professions, trades and calling-s, to the Irish Roman Catholics therein em-
braced, does so on the condition, that they should not ί· neglect or refuse to take the Oath of
Allegiance made by Act of Parliament in England in the First Year of the Reign of their
present Majesties‚ when thereunto required-’¹ That Oath was as follows: ¹¹ J, A. B., do sin-
cerely Promise and Swear, That Iwill be Faithful and bear true Allegiance to their Majesties⁹
