Polie Adrion 11⁷. 's hall, granling Ireland to Henry II. ofEngland, α genuine document, not-
withstanding tlte z'mpeaclmzent ofits ‹tzctlzentieity by some writers.

Of this grant of Ireland to Henry IL, by Adrian IV, the following account is given by
Dr. Lanigan: ‘⁵ Henry IL, who became King of England about the same time that Adrian
was placed on the chair of St. Peter, on being informed of his promotion, wrote to him a com-
plimentary letter of congratulation; and, having thus opened the way for obtaining favours,
applied to him, in the year 11:35², by means of John os Salisbury, then Chaplain to Theobald,
Archhishop of Canterbury, for a really important one. John, addressing the Pope in the
King‘s name, asked him for permission of his master to take possession of Ireland, for the
purpose ofextending the boundaries of the Church‚ of announcing to unlearned and rude peo-
ple the truth of the Christian saith, and exiii-pating the weeds ofvices from the field of the
Lord. What an apostolical and exemplary sovereign was Henry plantagenet! It is strange,
that the Pope could have listened to such stuff, while he knew that palliums had been sent, only
three or four years before that time, to Ireland, by his patron and benefactor, the good Pope
Eugenius III.; and must have been informed by Cardinal Paparo, who was, as st. Bernard
states, a very worthy man, that many good regulations had been made3 that there were ex—
cellent Bishops in this country, such as Gelasius of Armagh, and Christian of Lismore3 and
that the Irish Church was not then in so degenerate a state, as to require the intervention, or
the pious exertions, of such a King as Henry. But the love of his country (England), his wish
to gratisy Henry, and some other not very becoming reasons, prevailed over every other con-
sideration ; and the condescending Pope, with great eheerfulness and alacrity, took upon him-
self to make over to Henry all Ireland, and got a letter or Bull drawn up to that effect, and
directed to him, in which, among other queer things, he wishes him success in his undertaking,
and expresses a hope, that it will not only conduce to his glory in this world, but likewise to
his eternal happiness in the next. He founds his right for making this grant on the notable
principle, that lreland and all the islands, which have received the Christian saith, undoubtedly
belong to St. Peter, and the holy Roman Church. Adrian requires of Henry to preserve the rights
of the churches inviolate, and that, as he had promised to do, he would take care that a denarius
should be annually paid from every house to St. Peter. He sent to him, by John of Salisbury,
a gold ring, adorned with a valuable emerald, as a token of investiture of his right to govern
lrelaud 3 which ring, it was ordered, should be kept in the public archives.'' The Doctor adds,

that ‘⁶ this charge of a denarius, vulgarly called a penny, was in imitation of the Peter-pence,
