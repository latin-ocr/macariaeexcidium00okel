ilsev'noir os Colonel Clzarles O'Kelly.

by those of opposite sentiments to the Colonel, that, if he came, there would be
no agreement, the proposal was ποί acted upon. After the conclusion of the
Treaty of Limerick, the veteran retired to his family residence at Aughmne,
or Castle-Kelly‚ where, entirely separated from public affairs, he devoted the
remaining years of his life to literature and religion.

His first work appears to have been the Maoma'oe Eveidizmz‚ since, we are
informed, it was written as a sketch os the War of the Revolution in Ireland,
and soon after its termination, lcst, at his advanced period of life (he being in
his sevcntieth year when that contest ended), death might prevent him leaving
the fuller narrative on the subject, which he intended& The Macarioe Exeidium
is not, according to a supposition respecting it, the work of a Pm'ry Counez'llor
of King James II.; in no list of whose Irish Privy Cozmcil is the Colonel's
name to be found. Hence, it necessarily contains several statements and opi-
nions with reference to that Monarch, and his Vieeroy, the Duke of Tyrconnell,
as well as other members of the King's government, which require to be checked
and corrected by such official documents and personal memorials as we have of
that government‚ and of those who formed a portion of it. It might also be
wished, with respect to the flsaeariae Eveidium, that, as a work on a military
period, its contents had been more of a military, and less of a political‚ nature.
But, considered on the whole, or as intended to be a brief, yet general, outline
of the War of the Revolution from one belonging to the racc, religion, and cause
with which its author was connected, the Alacarioe Excidz'um may be safely pro-
nounced‚ a contribution to the history of that period, for which we have reason
to be grateful to Colone] O'Kelly.

The Colonel's second historical work, long preserved in the F rench branch
of the race of O'Kelly, or that of O'Kessy F arrell, was known among the
family as ‘⁶ lee O'Kelly Alsemoirsff' The volume containing them was in ex-
istence down to the F rench Revolution under Louis XVI.; when it was in the

possession

ἓ It may be observed here, in reference to a notion
which has existed, as to the Colonel having written
his work originally in Irish, that Mr. O‘Donovan,
whose opinion, ou a question of the kind, may be re—
garded as decisive, thinks, from the whole interna]
evidence of the work, such could not have been the
case. The idea, too, of its having been “ written origi-

nally in Syriacs' or (according to the meaning of the
word, as explained in the key) the F renelz language,
would only appear to have been adopted, as a portion
of the general mystery connected with the produc-
tion. The reasons for this mystery, those acquainted
with the history of Ireland, for a long period after
the Treaty of Limerick, will sufficiently understand.
