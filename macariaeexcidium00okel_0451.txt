Lieutenaut- General Baron de Ginlzell attae-ks Ballymore, and is stated to have taken it without
appositiva, on llze eth of J mle, 1691 ,· the Governor and garrison being made prisoners uf
war.

Colonel O'Kelly has been incorrect in asserting, that Ballymore was taken ‘⁶ without op-
position'' by Baron de Ginkell. The Dutch General came before Ballymore about twelve
o'clock on the 7th of June, and summoned the Irish Governor, Colonel Ullick Bmke, to sur-
render. But Burke held out until the next day. Then, there being no greater artillery in
the place, according to Story, than “two small anlzislz Pieces, mounted upon old Cart-
Wheels,'' as opposed to four batteries of cannon and one of mortars‚—the works of the Fort
being found unable to stand against the very superior fire of those five batteries,--and the
Irish Engineer, Lientenant-Colonel Burton, being slain‚—the place was surrendered at dis-
cretion. By Ginkell's letter from Dublin, of May 24th‚ 1691, to Lord Nottingham, acquaint-
ing his Lordship with the design of marching towards the Shammn, the Dutch General ap-
pears to have considered Ballymore‚ as ineapable of offering any opposition of consequence, to
the force Ιιε could bring against it. “ La risolutions’ he observes, ⁶· est prise de marchei*
droit zi la riviere. si tost que nous aurions pris Ballymoor, qu'apparament ne fera pas de longue

resistance''¹.

Baron de Ginkell remained, according to Story, until the lssth, at Ballyumrffi repairing
and strengthening the works, which Ullick Burlze's resistance had obliged him to batter down.
On the leth, he marched from Ballymore to Ballyburn Pass, where he encamped for the
night; was joined by the Duke of Wirtemberg and Count Nassau, with 7000 foreign merc-e-
naries; and himself went out, with a party of horse, to reconnoitre Athlone. “ Very early''
next morning, June leth, it is added, that the advance-guard os his army, (then about 18‚000
mem) moved forward, to drive the Irish outposts into the works of the English Town of Ath-
lone. or that halfofit on the Leinster side of the Shannon, which was not effected, till near
“ nine a clock.'’

Of this last circumstance, and the capture of the English Town by Ginlzell, King James's
Memoirs, after mentioning the appearance of the Williamite forces before Atfflone, give this
