Gentleinen of both those Surnames, but all their Friendes and Dependants‚ did pass into
Eugland, leaving their Lands and Possessions to be ouer-run by the Irish''¹.

Habitations in the Plaz'nes and open Conntries ,· wher they found most fruitfull and profitable
Lauds, and turned the Irish into the Wvods ὅ* Mountains : which, as they were proper Places
for Out-lawes and Theeues, so were they their natm-all Castles and Fortifications 3 thither they

Fast-places they kept vnknowne, by making the lVayes and Entries thereunto empassable3 there
