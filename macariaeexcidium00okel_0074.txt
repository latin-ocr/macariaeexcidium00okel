held for Amasis in the Province of Lapitlzia‚ which was lost for Want os
Provisions; sor the Concerns os unfortunate Amasis were ill managed by
those whom he trusted with the Administration of publick Affaires.

39. The Rumor that spred of T lzeoclords comeing in Person to invade
Cyprus that Summer‚ encouraged his Par-ty there to indure the last Ex-
tremity, in Hope of seeing now a speedy End of the Warr. But it did
not soe much alarm Ατηαείε, who seemed as if he were resolved (in case
T heodore had not come over that Season) to make noe great Effert to
expell the Cilieicwzs out of Cyprus. This Resolueion was beleived to
proceed from a wrong Maxim of State, which his evill Councellors
prompted him to embrace, that the onely Way to recover Cilicia was to
loose Cyprum for they perswaded him that, Cyprus being once reduced,
the Cilic-[ans would imediately recall him, as they formerly brought in his
Brother, Pytlz.a90r‹zs; but this was a Favour he could not hope for whilst
he headed a Cypriam 01· a Syriam Army3 and soe, like the Dog in the
Fame, he must lett goe the substance to snatch at the Shadow. [And,
besides, they perpetually rung it in his ears, that even should the Cili-

quibus publica negotia commissa erant, soede ac misere ubique pessumda-
bantur.

39. Ferebatur interim, sparso passim rumore, Theodorus Cyprum ea aestate
summis viribus invasurus: qua spe erectis partium animis, et haud dubium
belli finem approximare augurantibus, intoleranda qumque ao durissima pati
destinavere. At Amasis nee presentium necessitate rerum, nec imminentium
metu adactus quidquam grande aut arduum moliebatur, certus animi, si T heo-
dorus ea tempestate non supervenisset, nihil gravioris momenti eniti, quo Ci-
licum copias Insulam jam persultantes expelleret. Hanc autem illius menti
voluntatem subjecerunt Aulicorum praecipui, praepostero consilio inter regni
secreta tenendum dictitantes suadentesque, unicam esse reeuperandae C'ilz'cz'oe
viam, si Cyprum amitteret: magno enim conatu nimiae facilitatis Principi in—
gerere aggressi sunt, Cilicas, redacta semel sub potestatem Cypro, ut Pytlzaqo-
ram fratrem olim revocassent, ita ipsum uno omnium consensu mox in avitum
solium recepturos. O vanas hominum cogitationes! quid aliud tanto labore
