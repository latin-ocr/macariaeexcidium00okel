⁴· The greatest disadvantage of au was, that, while
wc conferi-cd nothing on the Church of Christ in
our new principality, we not only did not think it
worthy os any important bounty, or of due honour,
hut even, having immediately taken away its lands
and possessione, have exertcd oiirselve5‚ either to
mutilate or abrogate its former dignities and ancient
privileges.‘' On these passages of Canibrensis,
Ductor Lanigan exclaims: “ Thus it was. that the
English adventurers fulfilled the expectations of
the Popes Adrian IV. and Alexander ΙΙΙ. !'' Upon
this head, it should be noted, that what was done
in Englaud and NVales, at the expense of the Sax-
ons and Welsh‚ by the Normans, in the reign of
William the Conqueror and his immediate descen-
dants. was done in Ireland, at the expense of the
Milesian or aboriginal population, by the Angla-
Normans, wherever they were able. in and subse-
quent to Heni-y IL's reign. In both islands, the
needy and rapacious foreign adventurers‚ who came
over, in order to make the fortunes of themselves
and their connexions and followers, at the cost of
the plundered nativas, at first laid hands, as far as
they could, on ecclesiastical as well as lay property.
Of this spoil, those foreigners or their heirs. in Ire-
land as well as in Englaud and Vv'ales, from time to
trime, indeed, gave back a portion for Church pur-
poses. in the shape of monastic foundations, &c.;
doing this, however, as far as possible, for the crea-
tion of a conqueror's ascendancy in Church as well
as in State, by substituting for, or elevating over, the
native clergy, ecclesiastics of foreign birth οι· de-

But, from the narrow limits of the Anglo-Norman
power iu Ireland, οι· that of the Pale and the set-
tlements connected with it, this ecclesiastical policy
could not be acted upon by the Anglo-Norman set-
tlers, or their posterity, to such an extent in this
country, as it was by the Norman conqueror-s in
the neighbouring island. Thus, Sir John Davies.
Attorney-General to James 1.‚ the first REAL, or
universally and peaceably acknowledged, British
Sovereign in lreland, says: ‘⁴ The Abbies and reli—
gious Houses in Tirone, Tircunnell, and Fermun-
nayh, though they were dissolued in the 33 of Hen-
ry Β. were neuer surueied nor reduced into Charge.
but were continually possest by the religions Per-
sons, vntil his Maiestie that now ἦε, came to the
Crowne.’· This, with another circumstance. or that
of certain Irish Sees not having been filled up
by the Sovereigns of England until the time of
James 1., Sir John commeuts upon, as ‘⁶ an Argu-
ment eyther of great Negligence, or of great Weak-
nesse iu the State aud Gouernours of those Times.''
These observations are the more necessary to be
made, as our Irish writers do not hitherto seem to
have generally understood, on what leadiny principle
to reconcile the various examples of “ robbing Peter
to pay Paul‚” displayed by the conduct of our Anglo-
Norman invaders, in plundering churches and reli-
gious houses on the one hand, and founding them
on the other. But, in any view of the case. the
invaders did not act in accordance with the alleged
object, for which Ireland was given over to Henry
11. by the Popes,-or that of not only preserviny
but enlarqiny the privileges of the Irish Chul-ch.
