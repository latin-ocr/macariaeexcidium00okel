nastery of Cong, where he died in 1198, aged 82. The above instance of undutifulness and
rebellion was, unfortunately‚ not the only one, against which Roderic had to struggle in his
own family. In the subsequent frequent and sanguinary contentions of the O'Conors with
each other for supreme power, the Anglo-Normans were invited as auxiliarios into Connaught,
and obtained their settlements there, at the expense of the old inhabitants. According to
Dr. Charles O'Conor‚ Turlough Don, who was slain December 4111, 1406, was the last of
the O'Couors, that was styled King of Connaught. And thus, in the language of an old
writer, cited by Mr. Dalton, “because they were not themselves steady to each other, they were
crushed by lawless power, and the usurpation of foreigners. May God forgive them their sins l''

111 connexion with the undutifulness of Roderic's children towards him, it is not a little
remarkable, that it should have been by the wickedness and divisions of chry’s sons, HE was
chiefly prevented from subduing Ireland. ‘⁶ This vnnatural Treason of his Sons‚'’ says Sir
John Davies, ‘⁶ did the King expresse in an Embleme painted on his Chamber at Wiuclzester.
wherein was an Eagle. with three Eglets tyring on her Brest; ἃ 1118 fourth pecking· at one of
her Eyes''“. The bad feeling these four sons had towards each other, as well as towards their
father, is thus conveyed iu the curious anecdote related of one of 1118111, Geoffroy, Count of
Brittany‚ when requested to make peace with his father : “ Des messagers,” says my autho-
rity, ‘⁸ vinrent alors le trouver de la part du vieux roi, et le pressorent de mettre fin 11 un

debat, qui n'etait avantageux qu'aux ennemis communs de sa. famille. Entre autres envoyes‚

when defeated by the Welsh in llll-⁷), revenged
himself on his Welsh hostages, consisting of the
children of the nohlest families of XVales, by having
the eyes os the boys rooted out. as well as the ears
aud noses of the girls amputated. Henry's son,
Richard Ι.. 01· Coeur de Lion, and Philip Augus-
tus, King ot* Franco, during the war between them,
which conunenced iu 1194, frequently preferred
putting out their prisoners' eyes to ransoming them.
After the death of Donald &lh-ion, King of Tho-
moud, in 1194. the Anglo-Normans, having invaded
his dominious and taken 1115 5011, Murtogh, prisoner,
deprived him of 1115 eyes. More than two centu-
ries afterwards, under the reign uf Henry IV.
in England, 1111 Act was passed to make that prac-
tice a felony, in which it is spoken of, as a crime
that was “ very frequent.” On the other haud, we
read of Dermod Mac Murrough, in 1140, having
the eyes plucked out of several of the nobility of
Leinster. Mac Gilla Patrick, Prince ot' Ossory,
intiicted a. similar punishment upon Dermod's son.
Roderic O‘Gonor, to hinder two of his brothers
from ever hemming his rivals for power, caused

vint
their eyes to be put out3 besides afterwards con-
demuing his son Morrogh to a like fato. In 111οη-
tioning the blinding of the young Emperor ot' Con-
stantinople, John Lascaris, in 1261, by Michael
PalzeologuS, and, at the same time. alluding to tho
frequency of such a crime nmougst the modern
Greeks, or Romans as they styled themselves, Gib-
bon says—‘⁴ The word aluminum, 111 Latin and Ita-
111111, has furnished Duc-ange (Gloss. Latin.) with
an opportunity to review the various modes of
blinding: the more violent were scoopiug, burn-
ing with an iron or hot vinegar, aud binding the
head with a strong cord, till the eyes burst from
their sockets.’'- (Lingard's History of England,
