since his days. as it is no longer to be found there. Nevertheless, the eminent Irish scholar,
Peter O'Connell‚ who died so recently as 1824, had a copy of this history of the Irish wars
against the Danes, since, for the purpose of showing the meaning to be attached to various
Irish words, he quotes several portions of it, in his valuable, though unpublished, [rish-English
Dictionary. “ Henceforward, nothing more was known respecting this work on the Danish
wars until 1846, when one of our members, Mr. S. H. Bindon‚ being at Brussels, fortunately
found, amongst the MSS. of the Burgundian Library there, a fine copy, in the handwriting
of Michael O'Clery, one of the Four Masters; probably the very same copy which formerly
belonged to Colgan. This, being subsequently inspected by another of our members, the
Rev. Charles Graves, the Rev. J. H. Todd, our Secretary, went in 1848 to Brussels, collated
the Trinity College fragments with the O'Clery copy there, and, by supplying from the latter
what was deficient in the former, has thus placed a transcript of the entire at the disposal of
the Irish Archaeological Society for publication, when sufficient funds can be obtained for
printing it, along with a translation into English, and illustrative notes, from Danish as well

as Irish sources” Ρ.

The first plantation ofthe Irish Dalriadic colony in Alba, Albany, or North Britain, and
their ultimate acquisition of the modern kingdom of Scotland, have been already noticedffi us
well as the expedition against Roman Britain, in Agricolas time, by the Irish monarch Crim-
than or Criomthan ΙΙ., surnamed Nianair‘. But, long before Crimthan's reign, it would
appear, from the testimony ot'the Irish annalists, combined with that of the Roman panegyrist,
Eumenius, that the Irish used not only to make attacks upon Albany, but upon Southern Britain,
or that portion of the island subsequently conquered hy Rome, and now styled England. After
