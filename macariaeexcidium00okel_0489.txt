From what Major Tempest states of the success of the Irish in the centre, though Story
conveys the impression of Colonel Erle's having gotten off in the struggle, it would appear,
that Ede, and other officers os his regiment, became just as much prisoners as Colonel Herbert
was, or were kept so until the eventual passage, by their horse, through the boggy causeway,
near the Castle of Aughrim; which circumstance, by disabling the Irish from keeping their
prisoners where they were, or conveying them elsewhere, would either facilitate the escape of
those prisonem, 01· cause them to be killed, in order to prevent their being rescued. Major
Tempest's words respecting Colonel Herbert are, “ We lost one Colonel, which was Herbert‘,
and cut to pieces after quarter.'‘ And of the capture of Colonel Erle, &c.‚ in the centre, the
Major says : ‘⁶ Here Colonel Erle, with Captains Bingham and Gooking of his regiment, were
taken prisoners, but rescued afterwards by our horse, who passed a defile one by one through
a boggy trench‚''-or that by the Castle of Aughrim.

The Dutch account in Freneh, after stating of the slaughter made of the Irish—“ lls
perdirent plus de 7000 hommes, ou dans leur camp, ou dans la poursuite qu'on en fit, jusques
bien avant dans la num-then adds—⁴¹ Petit-etre quelques uns furent immolez au manes de
Colonel Herbert, qu'ils avoient fait prisonnier des que le commencement du combat, ἃ· qu'ils
massacrerent inhumainemenn Iors qu'ils virent qu'ils avoient du pire. Quelques autres Offi-
ciers qu'ils avoient pris en meme tems furent sauvez par la g‘enerosite de quelques uns des leurs.''

On the destruction of so many of the Irish army after the battle, the Protestant Jacobite,
Dr. Chai-les Leslie, informs us the following year, or 1692, that the Irish did “grievously
complain‚'' that there were “ killed in cold ss100d” of them ‘¹ at Aghrmn, above Tzro Thousand
who threw down their Arms, and asked Quarten after the English were absolutely Masters of
the Field ε and that several, who had Quarters given them, were after Killed in cold sslood, in
which Number were the Lord Galwny, and Collonel Clzarles Moore. And this is no Secret‚
the Major of Monsieur Epinglmm’sd Dragoons owned to Major General Doriugtou, That the
Lord Galway was Killed after Quarter, and the Battle over. More Vouchers might be pro-
duced, if needful‚” concludes the Doctor. Upon Lord Galway's death, under such circumstan-
ces, ‘⁴ Some say‚’' observes Story, “that My Lord Galway had hard Measure from some of our
Foreign Troopers, who kill'd him after he had surrendered himself a Prisoner 3 not to them-
selves, but to some othersst He, adds Lodge‚ ‘⁴ was a nobleman of true courage, and endowed
with many good qualities,*' and when ‘⁴ killed at Agbrim'' was “not full :22 years old.·· On
the general conduct of Ginkell’s army in the pursuit‚ “ the English‚‘' says Dastymple, ‘¹ dis-
graced all the glories of the day, by giving no quarter.''

All the tents, baggage‚ artillery (consisting, as has been said, of but nine field-pieces), and
a great number of the small arms of the Irish, either belonging to the slain, 01· cast away in
the pursuit‚ were taken, together with thirty-two pair of colours and eleven standards, accord-

mentioned. his own signature, ‘⁶ Abram d'Eppinyer.'’
