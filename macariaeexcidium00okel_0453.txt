troupes qu'il seroit necessaire.''

The great difference between the numbers of rnen with which St. Ruth is stated, in the
English and Latin texts, to have advaneed to Athlone on the :ZIst of June, and eneamped near
the Irish town, after the capture of the English town by GinkelL will be observed3 the Eng-
lish speaking of but “1500 horse and foot”-the Latin mentioning so many as “ 15,0001'‘
This ean, perham, be reconciled by supposing, that St. Ruth hurried forward to Athlone at
first with but 1500 horse and foot, and was followed the same day by as many more as made
up 15,000.

The best estimate which the writer of this note has been able to form of the largest force
St. Ruth had about Athlone during the siege, or both inclusive of the troops eneamped with
himselfsome miles to the rear of the place, and of those detached from them to garrison it,
would make the whole between 22,000 and 23‚000 infantry and cavalryf'.

The King, as has appeared in Note 209, so far circumseribed the Duke's previous power
in military matters, on account of the complaints against him, as to transfer the regulation of
appointments in the Irish Army to St. Ruth, who was also, no doubt, designed to have had the
actual command over that army in the field. Yet, partly, as Colonel O‘Kelly inflantes, from
a wish not to lessen too much the dignity of the royal authority in the Duke's person, and
partly, as the King's Memoirs allege, from a feeling of gratitude for the Duke's past services,
we find St. Ruth is mentioned, by the Duke of Berwick, to have been sent to lreland, “pour
commander l'armee sous le Vice-Roi !‘'—an unlueky loop-hole for that ruinous discord in the
face of an enemy, which arose when the Viceroy‚ as well as the French Gener-al, appeared
together in the same army. The royal Memoirs refer to the failure of the King's endea-
vour, to effect some sort of compromise between the conflicting factions represented by Tyr-
connell and St. Ruth, as well as to the other bad effects which such dissensions had, both abroad
and at home, in wealzening the Irish means of resistance‚ in this last and decisive campaign.
