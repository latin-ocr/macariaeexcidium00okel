Clare, for a time, was appointed to be a portion of Connaught, instead of Munster‚ will illus-
trate the Colonel's description. Having premised, how Connaught included all the territory

bounded by the Ocean between the river Erne which flows (out of Lough Erue) into the sea
near Ballyshannon in Donegal, and the river Shannon which reaches the sea below Limerick,
the English writer observes of Connaught, according to those limits: ‘⁵ lt is in a manner an
lland, bycause to the north and west, yt hath the sea, to the south and easte the Shenin, and
to the northeast‚ the loughe and ryver of Erne, onely one small slipp of grounde betweene
the Shenin and the Erne leaveth that parte vninclosed. It is devided at this present into sixe
countyes. Clare, Sligo, Mayo, Gallwaye‚ Roscommon and Letrim.··

Lieutenant-General Keatinge, who notes, that, when “ after the defeat at the Boyne, the
Irish army retired behind the Shannon, tln's was welljudged‚'‘ says, that, in a military point
of view, ‘⁵ the great object in the map of Ireland is the Shannon. This great chain of lakes,'*
he adds, “ cuts off an entire Province fron] the rest of Ireland, and may be classed with the
Eme, and almost with the Rhine; whose banks furnish so many important events, in the mili-
tary history of Europe‘·f.

Lieutemmt- General James Douglas, wille the I'Villz'czmite troops despatched to reduce Athlmoe,
υη hearing ⁰f Brigadz‘er Patriclt Sarsfield& approach from Limert'ck7 retii-es from Atltlone,
aud hastily retreat& to rejoin William..

The force with which Douglas was despatched against Athlone, consisted of fifteen regi-
ments; of which ten were infantry. three, horse, and two, dragoons. These, at their full
complements, would make about 1·2‚000 men. Douglas's artillery amounted to twelve or
fourteen pieces; of which ten or twelve were cannon, and two howstzers, or mortars. The
stock of gunpowder for this train was, however, insufficient, amounting to but eighteen barrels;
of which he had consumed fifteen, before he retired from Athlone on Mullingar.

Of the loss, plundering, &c.‚ connected with this expedition and retreat, until the alleged
junetion of Douglas with william, on the Sth of August, at Cahireonlish, five or six miles
south-east of Limerick, Story, who was with Douglas‘s force, says: “ We lost in this Expedition
not above thirty Men [1²] before the Town, and the Enemy very few 3 but in our March to and
again, what with Sickness, hard Marching, the Rapparees surprising [men] as they straggled,
and several other Disadvantages‚ we fell short of our Number three or four Hundred 3 though
before we got to the King's Army we kill'd and took Prisoners a great many Thwsands, but
more of these had Foun Feet than Two. All the poor Protestants thereabouts were now in
a worse Condition than before, for they had enjoyed tlte Benefit of the Irislz Proteetz'ons till our
