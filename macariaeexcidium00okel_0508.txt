As soon as James succeeded to his brother Charles's throne, he raised Colonel Talbot to the
Peerage of Ireland, and made him Lieutemznt- General of tlte Army there.

Colonel Riehard Talbot was, by patent of the 20th of June, 1685, in virtue of a wari-ant of
the 7th of May preceding, made Baron of Talbotstown, Viseount Baltinglass. and Earl of Tyr-
connel. “ These Titles,⁷‘ says Harris, ‘⁴ were granted to him and his lawful Heirs male, and
for want of such in remainder to his Nephew, Sir William Talbot of Cartowne, Baronet, and
his Heirs male, and for want of such to another of his Nephews‚ William Taibot of Haggards-
tumne, Esq.” The same writer adds, that the preamble to the patent, ennobling the ColoneL
mentions ¹‘ his immaculate allegiance, and his infinitely great services performed to the King,
and to K. Charles IL, in England, Irelmzcl, and foreign parts, both by sea and land, in which
he suffered frequent imprisonrnents, and many grievous wounds.''

Upon the appointment of the Earl to be Commander of the Forces in Ireland, the Eng-
lish Secretary of State’s book, in the State Paper Office, London, has this entry: “ Com¹¹ to,

Ae that time, the Army inlreland was eomposed of Protestants, whom, hy degrees, Lieutenant-
General Talbot got rid os, and supplied their places with Irish officers ancl soldiers, by
which means, he became the idol ⁰f the nation.

The Williamite Dr. King, under the head of “ King James’s Dealing with the Army of Ire-
land, in order to Destroy the Protestants and English Interest,’‘ says : “ The Army ofIreland
which King James found at his coming to the Crown, consisted of about 7,000‚ as Loyal Men,
and as Cordial to the King⁸s Serviee, as any could be; both Officers and Soldiers had been
inured to it for many Years. They looked on him as their Master and Father, intirely de-
pending on him, and expecting Nothing from any Body else. When Ilsonmonth's and Argile’s
Rebellion called for their Assistance to suppress them, no People in the World could shew
more Chearfissness, or Forwardness, than they did3 and it is observable, that no one Man in
Irelaud was ever found to be conseious or consenting to those Rebellions3 the Protestants of
all Sorts shewed great Horror and Detestation of them, and were discernably Melancholy till
the Rebeils were suppressed.‘'
