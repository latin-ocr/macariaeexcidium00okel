The brass money circulates well at first throughout Irelaml, from the previous want ofany eoin,
among the people‚ to carry ou trade.

The Jacobite journal, after mentioning the first issuing os the brass six-penny coins in

“ But‚'' observe King Jamcs's Memoirs respecting the brass money, “this proveing too
easy a resource when his Majestys wants emeretis-ed, occasion'd the coining twice as much as
was γε usual current cash of the Nation, which made it such a drug, that things were soon
sould for treble the rate they had formerly been at, and brought a mighty Scarcety of corn,
cloath and indeed of all things necessary for life; because no one was willing to part with his
goods for mony of 5ο low a value‚ if they could any ways subsist without it3 but what quite
ruined the credit of this new invention, was the bringing in of some french mony with other
necessary succors, which caused such a confusion between the great inequality of coins, that
the importation of forraign gold and sssver, which generally is the most solid benifit to a
Conntry, proved in some measure the ruin of this.'’ And, in another place, the royal Menioirs
thus allude to the effect which the conduct of the French was supposed to have had, in re-
ducing the value of the brass money. “ Their (lispiseing the brass mony brought the credit
of it so low, as it never had any sort of currency afterwards, and was one of the most essential
strokes to the King’s intrests that had happen'd ofa long time; sor it made him depend upon
supplys of mony srom France, which was so exceeding hard to be got, so long a corneing, and
so little when it came, that it only sel-ved to make his authority linger a while longer, but
e‹›uld not preserue it from certain death in the end’'¹¹.
