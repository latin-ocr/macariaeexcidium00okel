The reproach of the English with bad faith hythe Irish, which is represented to have
commenced at a very early period of the connexion between the two islands, is recorded on
another important occasion, or in Queen Elizabeth's reign, as well as in those of James ΙΙ.
and William HL, to have prevented the conclusion of peace, between the Irish and English.
The Annals of the Four Masters, having related how, in 1596, Thomas Butler, Earl of
Ormonde, and Myler Magrath, Archbishop of Cashel, were deputed by the Anglo-lrish
government to meet for the conclusion of a peace, on apparently fair terms, with the Chieftains
of Tyrone and Tirconnell, O'Neill and O‘Donnell, at Duudzzlk, then give this account of the
reasons of the lrish Chieftains, for refusing such conditions: “ O'Neill, O'Donnell, and all
the Chiefs of the Province who were then along with them, went into Council upon those
conditions, which were brought to them; and having reflected‚ for a long time, upon the
many that had been ruined by the Galls since their arrival in Erinx, by specious promises,
which they had not performed, and the numbers of the high-born Princes, Gentlemen, and
Chieftains, who came to premature deaths, without any reason at all, except to rob them of
their patrimonies‚ they feared very much¹ that what was [then] promised would not be fulfilled
to the1n3 so that they finally resolved upon rejecting the peace.''

How farjustifiaffle, or unjustifiable, nearly a century after this negociation, or during the
Jacobite war, was the aversion of the Irish, to conclude any treaty of peace with the English,
may be further explained by a reference to the immediate conduct, and remote causes of the
conduct, observed with respect to the Treaty of Limericky.

A modern English writer assigns the following reasons for the several breaches ofnational
faith by his countrymen in Ireland, sInce its invasion by them. ‘¹ The English‚'' says he, ‘¹ had
been2‚ though (ι superior people, yet not sufficiently 80, to warrant tlte attempt at domz'm'on by
mere force; they had been obliged, therefore, to afflet αη unity ⁰f z‘nterests and equality of
rights with their victims, wlzielz their illiberalz'cy sorbad them really to intend, and their inszff-
>ciem refinement incapacitated them to eff'ect. They had, in consequence, continually violated the

most solemn compacts, to which their want of brute power obliged them to have recourse'’³.
