of F00t‚ posted conveniently under Cover, by the Enemy, to obstruet our Passage. Our Home,
at this Place, were sustained by Major General Kz'rh's, and Colonel Gustavus Hambleton's Foot,
who after we had received the Ennemies Fire, sor a considerable Time, marched under the
Walls of the Castle, and Lodged themselves in a dry Ditch‚ in the Throng ofthe Ennemiex
Shot from the Castle, (cml some other old Walls, and Iletlges, adjoiniug‘. Those that have seen
the Place, and considered the Disadvantages that our Men had at such a Juncture to encoun-
ter withal, must needs Acknowledge the Action very Brave. For it's reported, that Mon>
sieur St. Ruth, seeing our Horse draw that XVay, and then begin to scramble over at a Place
where only two α Breust could pass& and that too with great Dffculty ; after all which, they
had no other Way to march, hut to gu within thirty Yards ofthe szstle. The Freneh General
seeing our men attempt to do this, askt What they meant hy it 3 And being answered, That
they would certainly endeavour to pass there, and Attack him on the Left; he is said to reply
with an Oath, They are brave Fellows, its ιι Pity they should be so exposed, or Words to that
Purpose. Our Horse, with much difficulty, made good that Pass; SirFraucss Compton, with my
Lord of Orcford’s Regiment, being one of the first that could be in a Posture to Engage, he
fell at Random in amongst the Enemy, and charged them briskly, with Sword in Hand : and
tho his Men were once οι· twice Repulsed‚ yet being seconded with Part of Major General Ru-
viguy's Horse, Colonel Langston's and some of Colonel Byerley's Horse, as also Brigadeer
Leveson's Dragoons, they soon made Good their Party on that Side, tho* not without the Loss
of several, both Men and Horses ..... But seeing our Horse press over towards the Castle,
he (St. Ruth) ordered a Brigade of his own Horse to march up; then Riding to one of his
Batteries, and giving Orders to the Gunner where to fire, he was marching towards the Place
where he saw us indeavour to come over, but was killed with a great Shot from one of oui·
Batteries, as he rid down the hill of Killhmnodon, the Place where the main Stress ofthe Battle
was fought, being just under the Enemies Camp. When Monsieur St. Ruth fell, one of his
Retinue threw a Cloak upon his Corps, and soon after removed him beyond the Hill, his
Guard going off at the same Time, which the Irish Horse perceiving, a great many of them
drew off also. I never could learn,’' adds the Williamite Chaplain, ‘⁴ what became of his Corps,
some say that he was left stript amongst the other Dead, when our Men pursued beyond the
Hill ; and others that he was thrown into a Bogg.”

King James's Memoirs,-after the statement previously cited respecting the mistalae in
the withdrawal os an Irish battalion from the edge of the morass towards Aughrim, which
enabled some of the English foot to get over, and the mention of the ‘⁶ four squadrons⁰ of
English horse there having likewise passed the boggy deflle, and begun to form themselves
upon the Irish side‚-thus describe the circumstances of St. Ruth’s death :

‘⁵ Assoon as the General was informed of the fault that had been made, he order'd all the

Cavalerie to march, puting himself at the head of it, which being extr-eam good would soon

the last-cited passage from Mac Geoghegan‚ as to the undertaking still more difficust, “passed adefile
