On the subject of James's θοι-0111111011, his Meinoirs say ι “ Tho he had reason to scruple
the communicateing in those prayers, preaching, and Cerimonys, which were perform‘d ac-
cording to the rites of the Church of England, yet his Majesty was so desirous to comply as
sar as any shew os reason or plausible excuse could warrant 111111, that he readily yielded to it,
so on the 23d of April (1685) the King and Queen were crown'd accordingly, with all the
splendor and magnificeuce which is usual on such sollemn occasions, and with full as much
publick joy and testimonys ofaffections as had been ever seen in former timess* ,Jamesv never-
theless, ‘⁵ retrenclied‚'' according to Rapin, ‘⁸ several things which caused a needless expence.
115, for instance, the cavalcade from the Tower to lVestminster, which was wont to 116 per-
formed the day before the coronation; saving thereby a charge of AE60,000.’' The same
historian further observes, that, during the ceremony, “ 1116 crown, not being fit for the King's
head, was often in a tottering condition, and like to fall offi'* Upon which he remarks 2 ⁸* The
people reckoned this 1111 ill omen to the King, as well as another thing which happened the
same day. ln one of the churches of London, the King's arms, painted in a glas-s window,
suddenly fell down, and broke in pieces, while the rest of the window was standing, without
possibility of discovering, why that part should fall sooner than the rest.'' ‘⁴ Finally: he adds,
*⁸ the 61111011)- carried over him did also break.‘’ “ 1 saw,‘' says another contemporary, Doctor
Hicks, ‘⁸ the totteringof the crown upon his head, the broken canopy over it, and the rent flag
hanging upon the white tower over against my door, when I came home froin the coronation.
It was torn hy the wind, at the same time the signal was given to the Tower, that he was
crowned. I put‚'' remarks the Doetor, ⁸ no great stress upon omens, but Ι cannot despise
them: most of thern, I believe, come by chance, but some from inferior intellectual agents,
especially 111056 which regard the fate of kings and nations''¹¹. See Notes 13, 15, and 16.
