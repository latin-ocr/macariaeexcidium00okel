From the lands of those regicides who had acquired confiscated estates in Ireland during
the Cromwellian usurpatim, an immense grant was made to James, Duke of York, after-
wards James ΙΙ. The number of Irish statute acres, so obtained by the Duke‚ is specified in
a manuscript document, inserted in Mr. Sheffield Grace·s Memoirs of the Family of Graee,
at 1‹;9‚431 ! Mac Geoghegan thus expresses himselfat this acquisition of Irish lands by James:
*⁸ ()n donna au Duc d'York les terres confisqusses de ces infames, Pouvoit-on transferer zi
ce Prince un droit que ces Usurpateurs n’avoient pas ? lls avoient posse-de ces terres en vertu
de la donation que Cromwell leur en avoit faite, pour recompense de leur parricide. Ce
tyran en avoit depouille quelques Seigneurs Irlandois pour la raison opposee3 leur ‹lroit

the ·‘ Cromwellian settlers‚'’ may be obtained, from the numerous original testimonias cited
by Dr. Curry, or from the more condensed narrative of Dr. Lingard. After mentioning
a final grant os compensation by charles to only ninety-four out of several thousand suffer-
ina,r loyalists, the latter writer observes: ‘⁸ But when compensation had thus been made to
a few of the sufferers, what, it may be asked, became of the officers who had followed the
royal fortune abroad, or of the 3000 Catholics who had entered their claims of innocence?
To all these the promises which had been made by the Act of Settlement were broken: the
unfortunate claimants were deprived of their rights, and debarred from all hope of future
relief. A measure of such sweeping and appalling oppression is perhaps without a parallel
in the history of civilized nations. Its injustice could not be denied; and the only apology
offered in its behalf was, the stern necessity of quieting the fears andjealousies of the Crom-
wellian settlers, and of establishing on a permanent basis the Protestant ascendant-y in
lreland.’‘

The number of Irish thus stripped of their· properties would seem, however, to have
