there was soe considerable, that Cor-idon and Asinio (the Syriam Gene-

Rally might hinder (at least delay) the Execution of the Design which
was hatehed in the Cabinett; the other was noe less troubled that soe
many of the Syricum appeared, after hc writt into Syria, and. perhaps to
Antiochus himself, that they were all, to a very few, cut 0ff; and the
Contrary being now made evident (for they did not loose 6 Men that
Day) he had Reason to apprclicnd, that it might bring his Credit and
Sincerity in Question at the Court of Syria: soe that these two great
Men being of one Resolution, tho' for different Emls, were linked
together in a Friendship that scemed everlasting. Asimo longed soe

turnam absentiam tam aegre molesteque ferebat, ut bellum in Cypro protrahi
continuarique ipso ei auditu acerbissimum esset. Nec incredibile est Ducum in
