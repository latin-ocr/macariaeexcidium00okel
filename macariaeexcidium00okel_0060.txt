Cilieicms were forced to return, to aid their friends and relatives in their
own country. This uncxpected change of affairs gave a respite to
the Cypricms, whose annihilation seemed previously inevitable, and ena-
bled them, in turn, to become the assailants‚ and regain the cities and
the territory, they had been so nnjustly deprived of. On this alteration
of affairs, the Cypriam granted considerable estates to those Ciliciam
who remained‚ and who were connected with them, either by wedlock
or affinity; but they annexed this condition, that they should assume
Cypriam names, and conform to Cypriam customs; so that, in a few short
years, these Cilician strangers and the Cypriam-5 blended together, and
became an united nation, and this union was daily cemented, by inter-
marriages and community ofblood and interest3 their closest bond being,

denuo invadendi. Tum Cilicibus, qui permanserant, per connubia et affinitates
secum junctis, satis spatiosam agrorum partem ultro concessere, ea tamen
lege, ut Cypria sibi cognomina adsciscerent, et Cypriorum moribus ac consue-
tudinibus assuescerent: unde brevi advena: Cilices in unum veluti corpus,
unamque cum Cypriis nationem coaluerunt: et haec charitatis vincula indies
magis magisque confirmabantur crebris inter se matrimoniis sanguinemque et
genus miscentibus3 sed communibus praecipue utilitatibus, et novissimis tem-
poribus Delphicoe religionis propugnandae arctissimo nexu, quam Cilices illi
