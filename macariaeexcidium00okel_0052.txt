of which himself would assume the command.

2 1. But this war was generally looked upon, not only as unjust and
unnatural on the part of T lieodore, who sought to despoil him, who was
both his uncle and his father-indm, (sor the sister of Amasis was his
mother); but equally unjust and impolitic on the part of the allied
Sovereigns, who, themselves of the Delpliz'c faith, joined with the most
bigotcd leader of the Illartanesians, against a most zealous observer of
the same religious rites. The Ciliciam Senate, to whom nothing could be
more acceptablc than that the Delplzic. rites should be annihilated‚ not
only in Cilicia and its dependencies, but also throughout Asia, exulted
and rejoiced, when they saw the Princes of that religion involved in
mutual strife‚ and exhausting their energies, in combating for an alien

acerrimo Illartanesz‘armn partium Duce armorum societatem inivisse. Cilicum
Senatus, cui nihil gratius accidere poterat, quam Delplz {cos ritus non in Ciliciae

cum Principes iisdem sacris initiatos civili discordia inter se commissos, alienae
causae militantes, suisque se veribus conficientes spectarent. Non enim ignora-
