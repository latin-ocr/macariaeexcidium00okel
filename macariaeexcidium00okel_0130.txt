the Kingdom in theire Hands) haveing transported theire Effects into
Cilicia ; and Amasis was not very fond of spending in Hast the Stock
of Money which Antiochus freely granted for the Support of the Warr in
Cyprus, least it might oblidge him to call sor more; for he did not love
to be too farr engaged to any forrcign Prince, foreseeing that the Reim-
bursement of such vast Sumes would exhaust his Treasure when he came
to the Possession of his Kingdom, which he soon expected, by the 11011111-
tary Submission of his deluded Subjects, when the Film that hindred
them now to behold theire F olly had been clearely taken off. He was,
therefore, advised by a Pamplzz'lt'an Privadoe to make use of this Copper
Coyne, to serve his present Turn in Cyprus, and Matters being once set-

pollicitationibus et simulandi artibus illusum erat, obedientia, cum semel,
