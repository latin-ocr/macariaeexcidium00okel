IlIemoz‘r of Colonel Clcarles O’Kelly. xix
dear Sir, Ι have been fool enough to let such things make an impression on
me, which, spite ofa good constitution, much spirits, and using a great deal of
exercise‚ has brought me to what I am. VVere I without a mother (I mean,
had I lost her in my infamy, and not known her goodneSS,) Ι could still better
have borne the steps that were taken; but, while I saw how lavish he was
upon his dirty * κε * * κε ³oe ἐκ, Ihad frequent accounts, that my mother was
half-starved abroad. She brought him Δ1Ε16,000 fortune, and, having borne severe
usage for near 20 years, had resolution enough to part with him, and chose to
take 38250 per annum, separate maintenanee, rather than bear any longer, and,
as she could not live here upon such an income, she has banished herself, and
lives retired, in a country town in Franee.'⁷

Captain Denis O'Kelly’s last surviving child, who gives this dark picture
of his domestic character, only outlived the writing of this letter till the ensuing
November, when she died in her thirty-first year, of a consumption‚ connected
with the melancholy effeets, on lter· mind, os leis bad and disgraceful course os
lise. The Captain's own decease taking place in 1740, the family of the author
ol'the lllacmvioe Rammium, in the male line, became extinct. The estate and resi-
‹lenee of Coloncl Charles O'Kelly reverteri, in consequence, to the son of his
brother John, of Clonlyon, the Lieutenant Colonel previously mentioned; and,
through this branch of the name, they have descended, in our time, to Denis
Henry Kelly, Esq.‚ of Oastle Kelly‘.
