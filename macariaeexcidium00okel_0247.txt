ment, arising from the Prince of Orange's intrigues against him, with the Emperor, the King
of Spain, the Pope, and others, as well as the disaffected English.

⁴⁴ The Prince of Orange‚'' it is observed, ‘⁴ had long ambitIoned the Crown of England. and
bore with great impatience the delay of a reversion, but now being cut off even from that ex-
pectancy by the birth of a Prince of Wales, was resolued to wait no longer, finding so favor-
able a disposition on all hands to second his attempt3 first, from the factious temper of the
people of EnglancL and their inclination to chang; and now especially, by reason of their
‹lisgust at the King's favoring Catholiclzs, and dispensing with certain laws, which disposed
them not only to receiue the Prince of Orzmge, but invite him to their aid 3 however all this
would not haue done his work, had not the situation of affairs in other nciboring countrys
seconded his design: The House of Austria had sor some time been projecting a formida-
ble League against France, whose former acquisitions had given them great disquict‚ and made
them aprehend new ones, so were resolved (if possible) to be bcforehand with it now. The
Prince of Orange's ambition to be at the head ofa powerfull army, and his inveterate enmity
against that King (Louis XIV.)‚ made him an earnest stickler in this League, which at last
was concluded at Ausburge‚ betwixt the Empire, the Kingdom os Spain, and the States of
Holland, and they had found means to render the Pope himself (who was at that timc ill satis-
fyd with the court of France) to be more than favorable to their enterprize; so that nothing
was wanting but the conjunction of England to make their force as formidahle as they them-
selves could wish it ; But the King (besides the little inclination he had to fall out with a Prinee,
his near relation and antient friend) haveing the prospect of enjoying a perfect peace. and
free trade, when all his Neibors should be engaged in war, made him gine no ear to the earncst
sollicitations of the Emperour's and King of Spain's Ambassadors, who press'd him violently to
enter into this Consederaoy ...... His Majesty looked upon the immugination of an universal
Monarchy (with which they stroue to fright him as a thing aim'd at by Franco) as a fantastica]
dream, both impolitic and impraeticable, as appear'd by Charles the 5th and Philip the Second,
but that were it otherwise, the situation of England still secur'd it so well against a French,
or any other encroachment, that newtrality was its true intrest; which made his Majesty gra-spe
at this occasion of eating out the Dutch, the Kingdom's rivals in trade, rather then to ent out
his own people's bowels, in the defenee of that Commonwealth, which never fail'd to leaue their
Allys in the lurch, at the least faint apearance of advantage by it.'’

’⁴ The Prince of Orange‚'’ continue the royal Memoirs, ‘¹ knew how to turn this disposition
and resolution the King was in, so as to second his intentions, by perswatling the Emperour
and King of Spain, that certainly the King of England had made. a private League with France,
and that there remain'd no means, but that of armeS, to remoue the remoraz, which the present
misunderstanding betwixt him and his people gaue a fauorable occasion of efecting 3 it is not
