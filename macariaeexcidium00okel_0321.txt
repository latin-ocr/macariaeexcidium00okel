Great weakeniug ofthe Irish, in tlte zvar against Quem Elisabeth, through the support given
to her by many Irislt Roman Catholics, especially those ofAnglo-Norman or English
urzgzn.

The editor of the Pacata Hibernia, in referring to the conduct of the Irish during the

well as the new, Irish (or those of Anglo-Norman or English dest-ent), who assisted the
Queen, in that war. He complains that, even in that contest, “minor pars Ihernorum ab
Anglis defecit.” He adds: ‘⁴ Si enim omnes [berni in Anglos conspirassent, vllo sine negocio

success ofwhich, on the. side of thc Queen, was the first of such importance, as to give the con-
test a decisive turn in her favour, Dr. Curry observes: ‘¹ Sir George Carew’s army, when
it sat down before Kinsale, consisted of 3000 men, ‘2000 of whom were of Irish birth.” He
likewise alleges : “ Itis also certain, that more than one-half of that gallant army under Lord
Mountjoy, which so successfully attached, and at last entirely defeated, Tirone'y (that is,
Aodh or Hugh O'Neill‚ Earl of Tyrone)‚ “was 1rish.” And, as an instance ofthe animosity
alluded to in the text, as existing amongst the Irish of the more modern, against those of the
ancient race, the Secretary of the English Lord Deputy Mountjoy, after his account of the
defeat of O'Neill and O'Donnell at the battle of Kinsale, December 24th (O. S.)‚ 1601, in-
forms us, how, when the fight was over, “the Lord Deputy in the middest of the dead
