Provincial Kings as well as a Supremo ἱΙῙοηανεΙι in ancient Irelcmd, and constant contentions-
for tlte sslvnarclzy, §scu

In describine· the ancient political system of Ireland, as “ a sort of pentat-chy, in which, in
addition to the four great provinces of Leinster, Ulster, Munster, and Connaught, was in-
cluded, as a fifth province, the district called Meath, which, though belonging naturally to
Leinster, was set apart, on account of its position in the centre of the kingdom, to form
the seat of the monarchy‚“ ΜΓ, Moore says :—“ The limited extent of this portion, as corn-
pared with the four other principalities, was supposed to be compensated, as well by its com-
manding position, and superior fertssity, as by the ample supplies and tributes which, in his
capacity of supreme ruler, the King of Tara was entitled to receive from the subordinate
princes. In the course of time, however? he observes, “it was found expedient to extend the
limits of the royal domain 3 and a tract ofland taken from each of the other provinces was
added to the original territory, forming altogether the country now called Meath and West-
memb, with the addition, probably, of a great portion of the present King's County.'' Never-
theless, he justly complains that ‘¹ the want of a controlling power and influenoe in the mo-
narchy, as regarded its relations with the provincial gwernments, had been always an anomaly
Nor
was this to he wondered at, when, “ in addition to the chief king of each province, every 51111-
ordinate prince, or head ofa large district, assumed also the title ofking, and exercised effec-

in the Irish scheme of polhy, productive of wmdmess, insubordination, and confusion.H

tually, within his own dominions, all the powers of sovereignty‘, even to the prerogative of
making war, not only with his co-equal princes, but with the king of the whole province,
whenever he could muster up a party, suffic-iently strong for such an enterprize.⁷'

In accounting for this state ofthings, the same historian remarks :—“ To the right ofprimo-
geniture, so generally ackuowledged in those ages, no deference whatever was paid by the
lrish. Within the circle of the near kin of the reigning prince, all were alike eligible to
succeed him ; so that the succ-ession may be said, to have been ltereditary as to the blood, but
elective as to the person. Not only the Monarch himself was created thus by election, but a

successor

⁰ This multiplicity of petty kings was only com-
mon to Ireland with other countries, in a primitive
condition. ⁴· without going so t'ar bai-k as theland
of Canaan in the time of JOShun, where every city
could boast its own king, wc find. that the small
and narrow territory of the Phoeuicians was, in a
similar manner, parcelled out into kingdoms; and,
from Homer’s account of the separate dominions
of the Grecian chiefs, it would seem. that they, also,
were constructe-d upon the same Canaanite pattern,
The feeling of clanship, indeed, out of which this

sort of government by a ehieftainry sprung, ap-
pears to have prevailed strongly in Greoce. ssnd to
have been one of the great cements of all their con-
federatfflns, warlike and political.'' It is added.
that, ⁴⁴ during the Heptarchy‚ the island os Great
Britain contained about fifteen kingdoms, Saxon,
British, and Scotch ; and, in oue of the smallest of
them, the kingdom of Keut. there were, at one
time, three chiefs, on whom the annalists hestow
the title of King.''—-(Moore's Histoi-y of Ireland,
vol. i. pp. 169-170.)
