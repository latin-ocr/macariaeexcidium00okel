Capitulation, δία, were duly ratified between himself and the lrish. And, finally, according
10 those Anides, 1119 place was evacuated hythe Irish garrison, and given up to him, on
Sunday, the 26111 of ι11119, or a week from the day he came before it.

‘⁴ This Town with a good Garison in it‚“ says Story, from whom the preceding particu-
lars are taken, ‘⁶ might have given us more Trouble, ancl so hare postponecl the Siege osz'me-
rit-kV : yet considering their present Circumstances, they did not manage ill in procuring for
themselves those Terms which they had, tho· the General might safely condescend to grant
any Thing included in the Lords Justices Declarafion, which both the Articles of Gullway and
Limerick are. At the same Τ11119,” he continues, “that Galluwy was Capitulating, there came
a Drum from Limerzklc, which put us in Hopes that all was over, and that they had a Mind to
make Terins not only for Gallu-ny but for the Iris-lt Nation in general, but it was only about
the Exehange or Releasing of some Prisoners, which at that Time could not be granted, or
rather it was to understand what became of Gallway, that so the others might take their

Measures accordingly.''
Yet, from the lapse of time which was to intervene between the signing of the Artieles of

Galway on the 2151, and the giving it up on the 26111, and from the great anxiety observable in
the correspondence of the Williamite Lords Justices sor Ireland, to terminate the Irish war
above all things, what Colone] O'Kelly affirmS, of such a delay having arisen from a proposal
nn Ginkell's part, that a capitulation should be entered into for the rest of lreland as well as
for Galway, seems by no means improbable. The Williamite Lord Justiee, Coningesby, for
instance, writing tovGinkell from Dublin‚ July 21st (or the day the Articles of Galway were
signed), has this postscript to his letter z “ My Lord, it is my opinion, that this war should he
ended upon any terms3 and though it seems to be so near something, yet nobody can answer
for ye events of war''w.

The 26th of July was the som-teenth, and not the fifteenth, day after the 12111, 01 that on
which the battle of Aughrim was fought. Respeeting the surrender of Galway by the 1rish,
Story says: *⁸ We continued a Friendly Correspondence till Suuday the 26111. when about
