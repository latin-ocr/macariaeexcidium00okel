menn, in a great measure, very inferiorly armed and disciplined 3 and with an artillery of but
twelve field-piceos 3 and William‘s army would be between 40‚000 and 50,000‚ or 45,000 men,
excellently equipped and diseiplined, or, as King James says, “most old regiments, well
apointed‚'' and with an artillery of between fifty and sixty pieces oflarge cannon, besides field-
mortars.

On the other hand, the Williamite Chaplain, Story, without giving any numerical parti-
culars concerning the artillery of either side, says, in the first-published portion of his work,
respecting the amount of the Williamite army: ‘⁶ On the 27111 (June) we marched through
szdatk. and encamped about a Mile beyond it, where the whole Armyjohoed, English, Dutch,
Dcznes, Germam, and Frenclz, making in all not above 36‚000, though the world call'd us a
third Part more: but the Army,'' he observes, “ was in all Respeots as well provided as any
Kingdom in the Worlsl ever had one sor the Number of Men.'’ In the second, or more
recently-published portion of his book, Story states: ‘¹ June the 27111, our whole Armyjoined
at Dzmdalls, making 111 all about 36‚000, though the World called us at least a third Part
more.’' Farther on, or after describing &Villiam's review of his men near Dublin, Story says:
“the compleat Number of our whole Army was at least 36,000.'‘ Coneerning the amount of
King James's army at the Boyne, Story, in the first portion of his work, without making any
separate mention of Lauzun’s French, states of the Irish : “ As to their Nuinbers at the Buyraee,
some oftheir own Officers call them five and twenty, and others seven and twenty thousand.’‘
ln the second part of his book, he affirnm, that “they (the Irish) were not above 27‚000 at the
Boytz, besides the Freneh.'’ These, under Lauzun, Story sets down at “ five thousand ;'' so
that, according as the Irish are taken at lzz's above-cited 25‚000‚ or 27‚000, the Jacobite army,
Irish and French, would, by this Williamite authority, be 30‚000 or 32‚000 men.

other words, about 4s,000‚ which Story says “ the world” reckoned the xx‘illiamite army to have
been, it is certain ‘⁶ the world'' was not without Williamite authority for doing so. Nieolas
Chevalier, in his medullio or panegyrical history of King William, in French, dedicated to the
Kz'ng himselfin Holluncl, in 1592, and published at Amsterdam that year, “ avecprz'uilffges‘ says,
that william found the army, with which he was to march against the Irish at the Boyne, con-
sisted of 62 squadrons of horse and dmgnons, and 52 battalions of foot, which might amount to
from 40,000 to 50,000 men. “ Il se rendit 231¹Armee,‘’ says that writer of Willia1n‚ “et la trouva

Ireland

¹¹ The most probable solution, for the differenee
of 3000 men, between King James, and his son the
Duke of Berwick, in their statements respecting
the amount of the Irish army at the Boyne, may be
given, by supposiug, that three regiments offoot
and five troops of horse from Minister, which
Story reports not to have come up till the day after

the battle, and to have then marched off untouch-
ed, may have been taken into the calculation of
the Duke as if at the action, because intended to
have been so3 while the King may not have in—
cluded them in his enunieration, as being aware of
their not having arrived in time, to take part in the
engagement.-(Story‘s Impartial History‚ p. 90.)
