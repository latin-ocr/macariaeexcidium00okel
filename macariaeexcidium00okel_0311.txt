¹* During this long period, the spirit of ancient manners shot a gleam through the chaos
of anarchy, in which it was enveloped. Histoi-y can afford some such examples. The clergy
and the hards had a mighty influence. lt was impossible that they could preserve the people,
nay themselves, from the consequent-es os a general degeneracy, in a state of lawless usurpa-
tions: buta retention of some ancient manners prevented them from sinlzing into absolute
barbarism, much less a state of savageness, what a very able historiam of our own time has
repeatedly charged them with.

“ The historian we mean is Mr. David Hume, who trusted to the accounts of avowed
enemies, and recommended the abuse of this people, by the vig-our of his style, and strength
of his colouring. Stanihurst, a less embittered enemy, would inform him better 3 not to men-
tion many other contemporary writers, who are still more impartial. ‘ Λ coarse and vulgar
opinion is generally prevalent, (says Stanihui-st) that these Irishmen have divested themselves
of all humanity‚ and wander dispersed and scattered, through the thickest forests, that finally,
they lead, uncontrolled, in brutal licentiousness, a horrid and uncultivated existence. But
they, who defame them with such calumnious railingS, are evidently partizans of falsehood,
in opposition to the clearest truth.'

“ The monasteries and schools,'' adds Mr. 0'Conor, of the native Irish, during the middle
ages, “ kept the remains of learning and humanity alive among them. Their seminaries were
unmolested in times of the fiercest hostilities between the chieftains : and no disgrace could
prove inore ruinous to any party at war, than the violatiou of those sanctuarios. This admi-
rable prejudice prevailed over foreign violence and domestic depravity, at all fimes: and to
its obstinacy we owe what stillremains of their ancient history and literana-w& Mr. O‘Conor,
however, in this last paragraph, should have used less general and absolute tei-ms.

We see, from what Davies mentions respecting the condition of the English in Ireland in
the reign of Henry VL, under whom the war above alluded to between the rival houses of
York and Lancaster broke out, that, though this war was one cause for diminishing the.
strength of the English settlers here, yet that their own weakness, and the successes of the Irish
