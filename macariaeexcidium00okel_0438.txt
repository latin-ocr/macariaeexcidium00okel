O’Halloran, who, as having been born at Limerick in 1728, or only about thirty-seven
years after the War of the Revolution, refers to, and could learn, several things froin imme-
diate contemporaries, as to the state of King James's adherents during that contest, informs
ns,-..n0twithstanding what Colonel O'Kelly affirms, as to the territory occupied by the Irish
army having been deprived of foreign cominerce,—that it was hy 3 barter-trade with France,
in which the Irish gave their wool, hides, tallow, and butter, for powder, hall, and aruis, the
war was so long maintained against. Willialn ΙΙΙ. And what O'Halloran states, to that effect,
is supported by the official information ot' William's Lord Justice for lreland, Coningesby, in
the State Paper Office, London.

‘⁴ ssy this expedient‚” says the Irish writer, in reference to the brass money, ‘⁶ the landlords
received no rents3 at least, the payuients made were of 110 real value. They then sent their
wool, their hides, theirtallow, and butter to France, to barte-1· for powder, hall, and arnis. Not-
withstanding this disti-ess, they knew King William wished for peace as much as they, and the
more solicitous he was for it, the more obstinate were they in refusing 11.” W'riting from
Dublin Castle, February 17111, 1691, 1110 Williamite Lord Justiee observes: “ My notion
proves intirely true, that it is not the King of France supplies the Irish3 he not being at one
penny's expense to do it. But it is the advantagious trade hither sor hides and tallow that
‹loes it; and while the merchants can make such vast advantages, with so little hazard, they
will furnish them to the end of the world; sor the pmfit is at this time about cent per cent,
and the trade with Irelaml is· better chan tlze trade wiclt che Imlies, and so will continue to be. as
long as their cattle hold ont.''

That what O'Halloran says⁵ as to the necessity of a peace to William having been calcu-
lated upon by the 1rish, when they persevered in their resistance by means of this barter-trade,
is proved to have been ajust calculation on the part ofthe latter, by the private admissions of
William's Ministers themselves. In the same letter from which the last-cited passage is taken,
the Williamite Lord Justice for Ireland, writing to the King's Minister, Lord Sydney, exclaims:
“ You know, my Lord, how little inclined I am to show any favour to the lrish, more then
what is absolutely necessary for our own sakes; but, I protest, I see every day so many diffi-
culties & uncertainties 111 our management, that Ι cant help wishing the war were ended upon
any terms”‘. And the Marquis of Caermarthen, another of William's Ministers, writing to the
Kingin Holland, from London, February eoth, 1691, and remarking that “affairs in Ireland''
seemed ¹⁶ to be in so ill a posture, and so likely to be worse than better,'’ that he offered to go
