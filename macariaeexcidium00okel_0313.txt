Discouery: but they discouered the Wealmes of the English dwelling in the open Plaines,
and thereupon made their Sallies and Retraites with great Aduantage.''

Thus, was a state of things existing, to a certain extent, in lreland, between the ancient or
Celtic Irish driven into the fastnesses, and the Teutonic colonies established by the Anglo-
Norman government in the plains, resembling that which existed in Scotland between its High-
land or Celtic population (the descendants of the old Irish) and the Teutonie Scotch of the
Lowlands, planted there by the Scottish Kings, to the exclusion of the more ancient or Celtic
population of the country. Referring to the Scottish Celtae, or Highlanders, M. Thierry
says of that population, in connexion with the recollections, which it retained of such a dispos-

ses-sion: “ Ε119 le savait, et se souvenait que les plaines occupees par ces nouveaux venus
avaient cte jadis la proprietf: de ses a'ieux: elle les ha'issait comme usurpateurs‚ et ne leur

donnait point le nom (19 Scots, sous lequel les etrangers les confondaient avec elle, mais celui
de Sassenaclzs, c’est-a-dire Saxons, parce que, de quelque origine qu'ils fussent, tous parlaient
la langue anglaise. Longtemps les enfans des Gaels regarderent comme de simples repre-
sailles les ineursions de guerre et de pillage faites sur les basses terres d'Ecosse: ‘ Nous
somnies les heritiers des plaines: disaient-ils, ‘il est juste qne nous reprenions nos biens*
Cette hostilite nationale, dont les habitants de la plaine redoutaient vivement les effets, les
rendait toujours disposes ἐι provoquer, de la part des rois ffEcosse, tontes sortes de mesures
arbitraires et tyrannique-Q pour ruiner l'independance des montagnards.*'

Concerning the recovery, by the original Irish, of those territories ofwhich the text speaks
of the natives as having been ‘⁴ so unjustly deprived,·’ the Anglo-Irish animust, Cox, with
very opposite feelings on the matter, observes, in his account of the transactions of Henry
VL‘s reign: “ The Publick Revenue was but very low, because the whole Kingdom was 111
Possession of the Irish, except the Pale, and some few places on the Sea-coast in [Μέθη and
even that was so far from being quiet, that they were fain to buy their Peace by yearly Pen-
sions to the Irish, and to pay Tribute and Contributions to them for Proteetion; which never<
theless was but very ill observed to the English. It cannot be expected I should give the
Reader an exact List of all that did pay this scandalous Contribution, and yet Iam not willing
to conceal from him the Account I have met with, which is as follows:
