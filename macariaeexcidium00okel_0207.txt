and political and religious contentions, at home. After premising, that “there are certain
omens and prognosticks, which sometimes precede and forebode the misfortunes of great men,
and have therefore been thought by the best writers, not unworthy of a place in history''‘¹, Carte
relates the following remarkable incident, which, and other occurrences ofthe kind, are men-
tioned by different authors to have been looked upon, as presages os the king's melancholy
destiny :

‘¹ Sir A. Van Dyck, having drawn the king in three different faces, a proffi, three quar-
ters, and a full face, the picture was sent to Rome, for the Cavalier Bernini to make a hust
from thence. It was given to that great master in his art by the Cardlnal Protector of the
English nation, who pressed him to make a good one with dispatch. Bernini was unac-
countably dilatory in the work; the Cardinal complaining of the slowness with which it ad-
vanced, pressing him to finish, and wondering how he could be so tedious in making the hust
of so great a prince, the other said that hehad set about it several times, but there was something
so unfortunatein the features of the face, that he was shocked every time thathe examined it, and
forced to leave off his work3 and if there was any stress to be laid upon physiognomy. he was
sure that the person whom the picture represented was destined to a violent end. The hust
was at last finished‚ and sent to England. As soon as the ship which brought it arrived in the
river, the King, who had an excellent taste 111 those polite arts, and was very impatient till he
saw the piece, ordered it to be carried immediately to his house at Chelsea. [t was brought
thither, placed upon a table 111 the garden, whither the King went, with a train ofnobility about
him, to take a view of the bust. As they were viewing it, an hawk flew over their heads, with
a partridge in his claws, which he had wounded to death. Some of the partridge's blood fell
on the neck of the statue, where it always remained without being wiped off, and was seen
by hundreds of people‚ as long as the bust was in being. 1t‚‘' observes Carte, “ was put over
the door of the King's closet atWhitehall, and continued there, till it was burnetl in the tire which
consumed that palace about forty years ago,''—that is from the year 1736, when his book was
published. And, with respect to his authority for this anecdote, he adds: “ Ι have it from a
very reverend author, who hath often seen the statue, and well knows the fact to be t1·ue''‘.
