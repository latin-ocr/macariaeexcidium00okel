us, from the Castle of Aughrim with its outworks in the possession of the Irish, are thus men-
tioned by King James, and the Jacobite Abbe Mac Geogheganr‘:

¹⁴ It seems in the begining of the day,¹’ observe the royal Memoirs, “ St. Ruth (pereeiveing
that tlze enemie, wlzo outnumber‘cl him, stretched out their left so far that he sear'd being flank'd)
order’d the second line of the left to march to the right3 but he, who was to execute that
order, caused a battallion of the first line to file off with the rest, supposeing the bog in the
front would prevent the enemies advanceing, but they who stood in awe of that Battallion
while it faeed them, took courage when it was gon, and by the help of hurdles made a shift to
get over the bog, and at the same time four Squadrons of the enemies hors, passing a causey,
began to forme themselves on the other side of the defile‚'’ &c.

Mac Geoghegan accounts as follows for the passage of the English cavalry by the Castle
of Aughrim, where Colone] Walter Bourke os Turlough, County Mayo‚ was stationed3 the
same officer‚ by the way, afterwards so distinguished with his regimem in saving Cremona
from Prince Eugene in February, 1702, and who died a Marechal de Camp‚ or Major-Generzss,
in the service of France, in 1715.

Having premised, how advantageous the French General's position at Aughrim was, the
Abbe says: “ Le Che-teau d'Aghrim, situe a la tete d'une chaussiee, le seul endroit par ou l'en-
nemi pouvoit aborder, masquoit son front: il emit couvert d'un autre cote par un marais
d'une grande {tendue Les ennemis, qui marchoient sur les traces des Royalistes, parurent
le Lundi ⁵22). du moisq‚ a la vue du camp, ἃ commencerent a defiler par la chaussee. Le Colo-
nel Gautier Burke etoit poste avec son regiment dans le Chateau, pour disputet a l'ennemi le
passage de la chaussee3 mais une meprise, trop fatale a la cause qu'il vouloit dkfendre, le mit
dans l'impossibilite de remplir son objet: ayant envoye demander au camp les munitioris dont
il avoit besoin, on lui envoya quatre barils de pondre & autant de plomb3 mais au lieu (le

par le marais ;'’ ἂρ.

Respeeting the advance of the right wing of the English horse through the boggy cause-
way near the Castle of Aughrim‚ iu order to get to the aid of their centre, and the death of
St. Ruth, when approaching to attack those who had passed on that side, Story says: “ The
Right Wing of our Horse in the mean Time were making what Haste they could to succour
our Foot; for seeing their Danger, and indeed that all was in Hazard by Reason of the Diffi-
culty of the Pass, they did more than Men, in pressing and tumbling over a very dangerous
Place, and that amongst Slzozcrs quullets, from a Regiment of Dragoons and two Regiments
