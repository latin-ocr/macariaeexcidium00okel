there were thirty; or ‘⁴ il y en avoit trente dans la ville.'' In addition to such an amount os
men and cannon in Derry, there was, from about the middle of June, under Major-General
Kirka (according to the authorities on botlz sides, or the French Engineer, Pointis, the Jaco-
bite Journal, the Rev. Messrs. Wallaer, Mackenzie, Story), an English lieet of thirty sail,
with arms, ammunition, provisions, and three regiments on board, (lesigniug to relieve the
place, and endeavouring to divert the Irisb, as far as possible, from an undivided application
to the siege ; those three reghnents, viz.,Ki1-ke's own, Sir John Hanmer‘s, and Brigadier Wil-
liam Stewart's, according to the usual complement of English foot regiments at that period
(exclusive of any supernumeraries), making between 2700 and 2300 men and officers. On
the other band, as to the strength of the Irish blockading force before Derry, the Duke of
Berwick, who was a General Officer in the service, says, that it was, in all, no more than
“ from 5000 to 6000 men;’' or, to use his own words, “nous n'avions en tout que cinq a six
mille hommes.'¹ The Irish siege or battering artillery he makes but six guns, or ‘⁸ six pieces
de gros canon ;” and, even of these gum, the Irish had not the full benefit against the town,
as they were, at different times obliged to remove them from before the walls towards
Culmore, to hindei· Rirke's vessels from getting, on that side, with provisions, into the
townk,

The Rev. Colone] George iValker's alleged amount of the Irish army at Derry, which
(without any notice being taken of the Duke of Berwick‘s statement upon the matter) has
been generally copied into English and Irish works professing to be historias, is as follows:
“Thus after 105 Days, being close besieged by uem· ⁵20,000 Men constantly supplied frosztbCin,
God Almighty was pleased in our greatest Extremity to send Relief ...... The Enemy lost
between eight aad aine thousand Men before our Walls, and a hundred of their best Officers,
according to the best Computation we could make of both, by the Information of the Prisoners
we took, most of these fell by the Sword, the rest of Fevers and Flux,” &c- That the Rev.
Colonel's assertions 011 this point should, however, be received with caution, even ifuot eon-
tradicted by the Duke of Berwick's Memoirs, would appear from his being accused by the
Rev. John hlackenzie, with not scrupling (though a clergyman) to misstate numbers, for a
purpose, during the siege, as well as with positive misrepresentation respecting the Irish.
The first charge against the Rev. 00101101, or that as to the misstatement of numbers, which
is mentioned as connected with the negociations, July 13th and 14111, 1689, between the agents
of the Irish army and those of the garrison‚ for a surrender, is thus made by Mackenzie:
“ While our Commissioners were out on the Treaty, Collonel Walker receiv'd a Letter from
Lieutenant David Mitchell out of the (English) Ships by a little Boy, and Transcribed it with
some Addz'tz'ous oflzis· men : For whereas the Letter mentioned Major General Kirks having
sent some to Encamp at Inelz, he wrote it 4000 Horae aml 9000 F00t‚- This humour was the more
unaccountable, because upon the Return of the Commissioners, he earnestly urged a Comply-
