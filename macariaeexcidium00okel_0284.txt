“ In testimony of this, I set down here the following arguments:

Ι. “ It is clear, from the number of the true nobility of Erin, who, in the end of their
lives, entered into the chief churehes, to finish theircareer in penitence, from the time os Brian
to the invasion of the Galls, that the faith was alive in Erin. These were some of them.
Flaherty O'Neill, called Flaherty αη Trostank, who first applied himself to penance in Erin,
and afterwards went to Rome on his pilgrimage, in the year of the age of the Lord 1073;
Donough‚ son of Brian Borumha, who went on his pilgrimage to Rome, and ended his life
penitently in the monastery of St. Stephenz Teige‚ son of Lorean, King of Hy-Kinselagh1,
who ended his life penitently at Glendalough ; CahaL son of Rory, King of Iar· Connaughtm‚
who ended his life penitently at Ardrnacha; Murtough O'Brian‚ King of Erin, who went to
Ardmacha, and spent tire years penitently there, where he died; and, in like manner, many
others ofthe true nobility of Erin, who spent their lives piously and catholiely, from the time
of Brian to the invasion of the Galls3 according to which, it is a lie for the people who palmed
upon Pope Adrianus, that the Catholic faith was not alive in Erin, before the Galls came into it.

ΙΙ. “Another proof which Ι give, that the religion was alive in Erin before the Galls
came into it is, that many monasteries were raised therein, shortly before the coming of the
GaHs, by the nobility of the Gaels. First, the monastery of Mary at Athcliathn was raised
by Maelsaechlainm King of Midhe⁰ and of all Erin, in the year of the Lord 1139. The
monastery of Mellifont, in the County of Louth, was raised by Donough O'Cearbhaill, King
of Oirgialla‘ss at the request of Malachaias. Bishop of Dun Patruic. The hoary Malachaias,
Bishop of Dun Patmic, raised the monastery of Iubhar Chinntraghaffi in the County of Down,
A. D. 1144. The monastery of Buillr was ra1sed in the year 1161. Dermod Mac Murrough,
King of Laighin⁵‚ raised the monastery of Bealach¹ in the year of the Lord 1151. The raee
of Maelseachlainm King of Midhe. raised the monastery of Bectiff, or De Beatitudine, in
Midhe, in the year of our Lord 1151. The monastery of the Maigue1*‚in the County of Li-
merick, was raised in the year of our Lord 1151. The monastery of Odtorna', in the County
of Kerry, was raised in the year of the Lord 1154. Donald O'Brian, King of LuimneachW,
ereeted the monastery of the Holy Cross, in the year of the Lord 1169. The monastery of
Fearainaighe¹, in the County of Cork, was raised in the year of the Lord 1170; and many
other churches and monasteries, not mentioned by us here, were raised in Bria, at this time 3
whence it is plain, that the Catholic faith was livingin Erin, at the coming ofthe Galls into it.

III. ‘⁴ A third proof, that the saith was livingin Erin at the coming of the Galls, is, that
three General Synods were held in Erin by the prelates and nobility of Erin, from the time of

Donough,
