humble submission he made to the Queene he had so highly and proudly offended much
eclipsed the vaine glory his actions might haue carried, if he had held out till her death:
besides that by his coming in, as it were between two raignes‚ he lost a fair aduantage, for (by
Englamls Estate, for the present vnsetled) to haue subsisted longer in rebellion (ifhe had any
such end) or at least an ample occasion of fastning great merit on the new King, if at first
and with free will he had submitted to his mer-cy, which hee would haue pretended to doe,
onely of an honourable affection to his new Prinee, and many would in all likelihood haue
beleeued so much, especially they to whom his present misery and ruined estate were not at
all (or not fully) knowne.''

“ The charge of the Irish warres in the last yeere 1602, beginning the first of April, and
ending the last of March, besides concordaturus, munitium, aml other extraordinaries‚’‘ was,
says the same official writer, ‘⁴ two hundred fourescore ten thousand seueu hundred thirtie
three pound eight shillings nine peuce halfe penny far-thing halfe farthing.’' The ‘⁴ extraor-
dinaries,‘' or ‘⁶ contingencies‚'' as Cox ternis them, must have amounted to a very large sum,
since he calculates them, under two previous years of the contest, at about ςἒ50,000 for each
year. That sum, added to the main charge above-cited of the last year's expenditure sor the
war, would make it, exclusive of shillings, penee, and fractions, so high as 4:34053& while,

Erroneons statements, as lo the Cliicjftains of Ulster havingflecl to Rome in Queen Elizabeth*s
reign, ancl as to the Queen having colonizecl the possessivus oftlte Ulster exiles with English
and Scotclz.

The text is wrong, in attributing to the reign of Elizabeth what did not occur until that of
her successor, James 1. The Ulster Chieftains, O’Neill of Tyrone, and O'Donnell of Tyr-
connell, after their personal submission to Lord Mountjoy, and the issuing by him ofa “ Pro.
clamation ofa General Indemnity and Oblivion,'’ assigning to every body,not actually attainted‚
his former possessions. and forbidding any private actions for what had taken place during the
war, went, in the year 1603, to England, to present themselves at Court. There, they were
most honourably received ; O'Neill being acknowledged as Earl of Tyrone‚ and O'Donnell as
Earl of Tyrconnell. The flight of those noblemen from Ireland to the Continent, the conse-
quent confiscatiom according to Cox, of 51 1365 acres in Ulster by the Crown, and the great
plantation of English and Seotch, but especially of the latter, in that Province, did not happen

until 1607, and the subsequent years of James I.'s reignp. N 80
