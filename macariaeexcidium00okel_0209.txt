Gom! reception ⁰f Clzarles I. in Scotland on his visit to Eclz'nburgh, (md eoronation, notwith-

At and for some time after the dccease of King James 111 1625, Scotland was unprece-
‹lentedly tranquil, or until Chanes, between 1626 and 1628, first attempted and finally suc-
eeeded in resuming that portion of ecclesiastical property, which, at the Reformation‚ had
‹levolved to the Crown; but which, during the disorderly period of his father's minority‚ had
been parcelled out, among various members of the Scotch aristocracy, by the Regents, Murray
and Morton. The feelings of discontent occasioned among the different powerful families,
from whom these possessions were thus resumed, finally had a share in effecting the Ix'ing's
ruin. In 1633, indeed, when Charles visited Scotland with a splendid suite of English
and Scotch noblemen, he was received with enthusiasim and his coronation excitcd much
popular joy. Yet this was not without so much dissatisfaction amongst the Sootch, from
what they considered good grounds for politica] and religious distrust‚-.-including a suspicion
of the King's having been secretly inclined to Popery !—that‚ observes Dr. Lingard. on the
authority ofa contemporary letter dated September 30, 1633, it was remarked of Charles
hy some, “that the Scots would imitate the Jews, and that their hosannas at his entry would he
changed into, ‘ Away with him, crucify him Γ Leslie, Bishop of the [sles, mentioned this at
dinner to Charles, 11110,Π it is added, “immediately turned thoughtful and ate 11011101·9.” Nor
was this observation ill-founded, since, from the differences already existing, and which from
year to year continued to increase, between Charles and that portion of his suhjccts, it was
Scotland that subsequently took the lead in that armed resistance to the royal authority, which
caused the downfal of the monarchy‚ and brought the Monarch himself to the b100k¹³.
