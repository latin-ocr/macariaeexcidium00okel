“ As for Der1·y,” says the Rev. Andrew Hamilton, in 1690, “no Truc Protestant will
deny, but the holding out of that Place against the IJ-islz Army was of so great Importance, that
the Safety of these Three Kingdoms did depend very much upon it. And it is well known, that
duringthe whole Time of that long Siege, the Men of Iniskillz'n kept at least the mie Ilnlfoftlze
Iris-1⁷1 Armysrom coming before Derry, and kept them in so great Fear of their coming to Re-
lieve the Town, that they dnm-t never malfe a Regzclar Attack upon tlze Placc, but wei-ejorcetl lo

Men‚’' he adds, amongst other observations respecting them: ‘⁴ Those Men have kept free.
