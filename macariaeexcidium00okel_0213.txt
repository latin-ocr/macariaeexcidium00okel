‘1 completely overthrown‚ and defeated with enormous slaughter ;'’ but, on the contrary, always
kept the field, at the head of his army of Ulster Irish, from July, 1642, the period of his land-
ing in the County Donegal, from Flanders, till November oth, 1649, the day of his death at
Cloughonter, near Cavan, in the old Abbey of which he was interred. His army then amounted
to <3000 foot and 500 horse. When he was arrested by his last fatal issness, he was on his
march to join the Lord Lieutenant, the Marquis of Ormonde, and the Irish royalist forces,
against Cromwell. This junction of the Irish General with the Marquis was to have taken
place, according to the treatyjust agreed upon between them, which, by uniting the entire
military strength of Ireland in defence of the royal cause, would have given the Royalists the
fairest prospects of effectually opposing the invasion of Cromwell and his followers. Carte, in
liis life of Ormonde, says of Owen Roe O·Neill: “ The Marquis of Ormonde had always used
great frankness in his treaties with him, and had a very advantageous opinion, as well of his
honour, constancy, and good sense, as of his military skill, from which he proposed as much
advantage to the King's affairs, as he did from the force of his troops.” And this high appre-
ciation of Owen Roe O'Neill, by the Lord Lieutenant‚ is sufficientlyjustified. from the charac-
ter given of the Irish commander„ by other writers, of both nations and religions. “ Owen

adds Doctor lVarner, ‘¹ was a man of good natural parts, much improved by experience in
his professiom in the exercise of which he seems to have copied after the model of the Roman
Fontis, by leaving very little to chance, in dexterously taking hold of any advantage given him
by his enemy, and in the utmost care to ati'ord no advantage over himself. . . . To his mili-
tary qualifications may be added his sobriety, moderation, reservedness, and knowledge of the
world.’' His advice before his death, as to the method of opposing the Cromwellkzns, was,
says Cane, “ that Cromwell should not be fought with unless upon great advantage, and that
he would sooner be beat by passeS, and the season of the year, without any hazard, than he
could by any engagement in the field, his army having been hitherto victorious.'' For,
according to Doctor Robert Gorge, Secretary of Marshal Schonberg, in a manuscript
memorial in the State Paper Office, London, written in 169l‚-“ well knowing the usual
mortality which attended new bodys in that country, Owen Roo Oneale, who was the best
Generall that ever the Irish had, waS‚ in that last warr, heard often to boast, that there were
Irish enough in Ireland to destroy all the Brittains [Britons] in England and scotland in an
Irish warr.'' Owen Roe‘s greatest achievement in Ireland was his overthrow, June 5th, 1646,
