2 54 Notes and Hlustrations.

Dr. Lanigan as the ornaments of the Irish Church, is attested by the following bulis or letters
of Alexander 111.. which, though on that account of such great historical value, have not
been duly noticed, in connexion with the important period to which they belong, by Irish his-
ποι-1111151 They were first published at Oxford, in 1728, by the learned Thomas Hearne,
in his Liber Niger scaccarii. In reference to these, and a fourth bull of Alexander in that
work, but unconnected with the present subject, Hearne gives it as 1115 opinion, “ Epistolas
hasce quatuor Alexandri ΙΙΙ. Pontificis Romani, subsequentes non viderat Usserius Arma-
chanus, alioqui proculdubio in Sylloge sua Epistolarum Hibernicarum inserturus. Hinc

nostrum nigrum insignens'e. Those bulls have been also inserted in the last edition of the
Foedera, printed in 1816, from which they are inserted here; the copies of them from the
Liber Niger Scaccarz'i being likewise given in an Appendix at the end of these notesf, for the
satisfaction of such as may wish to compare and reconcile the differences, occasioned by

transcribers or printers, in the two versions.

about tiftcen years before Adi-ian IV. ascended the
papal throne, which he <lid in December, 1154, and
about sixteen years before he issued the bull re-
garding Ireland, which was done a few months
after 1115. elevation to the tiara, or 111 1155. And,
as to Adi-ian himself, we find him to have had such
an intercourse with εει-1951351105, natives of Ireland,
at different periods of his life, that he was not
without good means, to aequaint himself with the
general condition of Ireland. Thus, in mentioning
the coming to Rome of “an Irishman of great
merit, named Gregory,'' in order to be confirmed
there, as third Abbot of the Irish monastery of
St..1ames at Ratisbon in Germany, Dr. Lanigan,
after stating how this circumstance is related to

Gregory ;-“ Η15 journey to Rome could not have
taken place before 1155, whereas Adrian‘s ponti-
ficato began on the 3rd of December, 1154. Among]

conrerned in hatching a plot against that good man's

cerning Ireland may be regarded, cun it be sup-
