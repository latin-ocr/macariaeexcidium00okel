of Sir Matthew Bridges. What tongue can express, or man describe, the extravagancy of those
joys, which possessed the Irish, at the arrival of this news. Their former apprehensions of the
shortness of their triumph, hy reason of King Janies‘s deelension in age, and the prospect of
a Protestant successor, bad extreamly imbittered their greatest comforts, and caus'd an inter-
mixture of hopes and fearS. But now, that they had got a young Prhxce, that would become a
patron to the Holy Chureh, this soon dissipated all their troubles . . . . ''I'would require a
volume to describe the particularities of those various soenes of joy, which they shew’d upon
this occasion. Let this suffice, that no arts of extravagancy were omitted, whereby to repre-
sent their bountlless complacendesvs. This is. of course, spoken of the lrish Roman Catho-
lics, for the Irish Protestants naturally felt very much as their brethren did in England.

The implication conveyed, either through carelessness or error on the part ofthe Author,
that it was in the course of a few days after the birth of the Prinne, that Williain's expedition
drew near England, is opposed to the real chronology of those oecurrences. The Prinee of
Wales, as has been seen, was born in June, lou& whereas William first sailed from Holland
on the l9th of October, soon after which he was driven back into harbour by bad weather;
and he again put to sea on November lst‚ and lauded at Torbay, in Devonshire, the 5th os

force consisted of fifty-two men of war, twenty-five frigates, twenty-five fite-ships, and near
