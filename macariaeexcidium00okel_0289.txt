¹ How far success attended what the Pope men-
tions, as to Henry's entitling himself to the pardon
of his sins, by reviving and strengthening Christia-
nity in 1reland, and by not only preserviny but in-
creusiny the privileges of the Irish Clnu-ch, may
be partlyjudged of, by the following statements of
some of the results of the royal mission to Ireland.
Dr. Lingard, having noted how, after the long and
barbarizing warfare with the Danes, the establish-
ment oftranquillity was prevented in Ireland by
the struggles of its different princes for supremaey,
observes: ‘⁴ It was in vain that the pontiffs re-
peatedly sent, or appointed, legates to establish
the discipline of the canons, and reform the immo-
rality οἳ the nation; that the celebrated St. Mala-

leaders, such as Robert Fitz-Stephen. Herve de
Monte Marisco, Raymond le Gros, John de Courcy,
and Meyler Fitz-Henry, as church-plnnderers; and
the Doctor thus translates and cites the Welsh
writer, as speaking of the wretched condition, in
which the Irish Church was consequently placed.
“ The misen-able clergy‚’' says Cambrensis, “is re-
duced to beggary in the island. The cathedral
churches mourn, having been robbed by the afore-
said persons, and others along with them, or who
came over after them, of their lands and ample es-
tates, which had been formerly granted to them,
faithfully and devoutly. And thus the ezaltinq os

to account for some losses suffered hythe invaders,
