The Williamite Lord Justice for [reland, Coniugesby‚ writing to Ginkell from Dublin four
days aster the battle, or July thh, 1691, says: ⁴⁴ My Lord, with what satisfactfl Irec‘¹ y‘
acet of y‘ ΕΧοΥΞ success, it’s impossible for me to describe, Ι may say yt no friend you have
in y‘l world (besides ye advantage it will be lo all Crisleuclome) ού be more pleased upon

Another English Williamite‚ the author of the defence ofthe conduct of Ruvigny, Earl of
Galway, in Spain and Portugal, adverts to the battle of Aughrim twenty years after it was
fought, or in 1711, as “the famous Victory of Aglarz'm, which decided the last Irish VVar in
Favour of King 1Villiam:” and further mentions the influence of that victory on “the late
happy Revolution,” as such, that it “ was not perfectlg( settled, till ellat Blow was give71.’'

In consequence of that victory, and the previous capture of Athlone, General Ginkell was
created by patent, March 4th, lG9l-92, ‘¹ Earl of Athlone and Baron of Aghrim, with 202.
annual creation fee,'' says Lodge. ‘⁴ And,“ adds the same authority, “as a reward for his
services, he had a grant, 13 October, 1693, of the forfeited estate of william Dougan, Earl of
Limerick (attainted 16 April, 1691), containing the castle, town, and lands of Castletown‚
the manor of Kildrough‚ ἀει, in the Counties of Kildare, Dublin, Carlow, Meath, Kilkenny,
Longford, Tipperary, and Queen's County‚ amounting to 26,480 acres, with several houses in

Dublin, and many tithes; all which were confirmed by Act of Parliament, 7 December,
1695.''

As to the total amount of the Irish slain at Aughrim, Story affirms, ‘⁶ We killed 7,ου0
of the Irish upon the Spot, as was generally believed, and there could not be many fewer,
for looking amongst the Dead three Days after, when all our own and some of their's were
buried, I reckoued in some small [nelos-zares 150, in ollzers· 120, ἅμ, lying most oslltem by tlte
Ditclzes where they were Slzoffl: and the Rest from the T'op of the Hill where their Camp had
been, looked like a great Flock of Sheep, shattered up and down the Countrey for almost four
Miles round: And the Irish themselves, tho they will not allow so many to be killed, yet they
own, that they lost more, which they could never have any Account of, except they stole home
privately, or else turned Rapparees.'’ See, however, next page.

According to the best Williamite return, or “Lz'st of tlte Irish Prisoners, taken at tlze Bal-
tel qughrim, on July 12. 1691‚¹‘ they amounted to 526 men of all ranks.

The contemporary Dutch account in French observes, with respect to the loss of officers
in the Irish army at Aughrim: “ Il suffit pour juger de l’opiniatrete du combat, de savoir
que plus de la moitie des Offieiers de l'Armee Irlandoise furent tuez ou faits prisonniers: ὁὶ
