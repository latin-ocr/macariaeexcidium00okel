Ginketl, learning tlzat tlze Iris-lc horse had removed so far from Lz‘merz‘ck, passe-9, September
⁴23rd, over tlte Sltamzon, u-z'tlz ttze greatest part oflzis cavalry, and a considerable body offoot,
by tlte brz'rlge Ite had made opposite Ctg'fforct's former position (hence styled Ctzfford's Bridge
in tlte English camp), cuts qfftlee Irt'slz ontguards, encamps half-way between Limerz'ek
aud tlie Irislt horse camp, emal tltereby hinders att conzmzmication between that camp aud
tlte lou-71.

lt was, according to the London Gazette and Story, on the 22nd, and not, as Colonel
()'Kelly says, on the 23rd, of September, that General Ginkell crossed the Shannon with a
large portion ofhis army, and effected the investment of Limerick, as above alluded to.

The final account, in the Gazette, of this affair, headed ‘¹ Franz the Camp before Limerick
in Thomonds-lsle‚ Sept. 28& after mentioning how on Tuesday, the Qend, the Williamite Com-
mander passed the river, and arrived before ‘⁶ Thomond-Isle‚‘¹ observes: “W‘hen he was
there, he ordered all the Grenadiers, together with the Regiments of Kirke, Tffn, and Lord
Genrge Hamiltmz to advanoe, and attack the. Works that cover Tltmnond Bridge, which they
did with such Resolution and Bravery, that they presently beat the Enemy out of them, who
would have fied into the Town, but the French Governor durst not let the Draw-Bridge down
to receive them, for Fear our Men should at the same Time have cntred the Place, so that
about 600 of the Irislz were killed, there being Nothing to be seen from the Foot of the Bridge
to the Draw-Bridge, but Heaps os dead Bodies, and about 130 were taken Prisonersk, among
whom was Colonel Skelton (who is since dead ofhis Wounds) 2 Lieutenant Colonels, :2 Majors,
9 Captains, 7 Lieutenants‚ and 6 Ensigns. All this while the Enemies Cannon and Small
Shot play¹d from the Walls, and the Warnith of our Men having carried them too far. they
were very much exposed to their Fire, and between 2 and 300 were killed and wounded, but
no Body of Note.''

Having mentioned, as already cited, the retreat of the Irish cavalry under Major General
Sheldon to Six- Mile-Bridge‚ and their having been, from inability to subsist there, ordered
back towards Clare, the royal Memoirs add, rospecting the subsequent investment of Limerick
by the Dutch General: “ Upon which,'' that is, the removal of the Irish horse with Sheldon,
“the Enemie passed a great body of hors and dragoons ouer their new bridg and came before
'rhomond gate3 at their first apearance Coll: Lacy with 6 or 700 men was ordei-'d out to

dis-pute

racity‚” and speaks of him “ as a witness beyond liam 111. p. 345, and Appendix, No. LXII. p. lxxv.
exception.'' Has his Lordship left behind him any k The ‘⁶ about 600¹⁸ Irish killed, and the “about
other memorial in writing, on the subject of this 130” os them taken prisoners, in this Williamite ac-
war? Such dommum, on the Jacobite side, as a count, would make more Irish to be slain and taken
journal or letters from him, if in existence, ought (or about 730) than were actually engaged, accord-
not to remain unpublished.-Harris‘s Life of Wil- ing to the Jacobite account that follows.
