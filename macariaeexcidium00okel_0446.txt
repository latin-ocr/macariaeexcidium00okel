The Dzdze of Tyrcomzell then called in the brass money, though lle is said ιο have brought no
silver eoin, to pay the soldiery, §fleu

This measure of decrying the brass money seems, by the Williamite accountS, to have
been attended, for a time, with good effects iu the Jacobite quarters; perhaps, from some
general impression having spread amongst the Irish, that the Duke of Tyrconnell would not
have cried down that base coin, unless he had brought either a greater quantity of French
money from the Continent than King James tells us was brought& or that more would soon
be on the way from France to Ireland. But, howsoever this may have been, for some time
after the Duke os Tyrconnell's crying down of the brass money, subsequent to his return from
France, we are informed by Harris, from his contemporary Williamite sources of intelligence
respecting the condition of the Irish, that “ they had exceeding plentiful markets occasioned
by crying down the currency of the brass money, beef at 6 or Ts. a quarter, and a good fat
sheep at half a crown or three shillings, and other things in proportion.'’

The Williamite Lord Justice Coniugesby, in his letter from Dublin of February 17th, 1690-
91, to Lord Sydney, likewise says, in reference to the Duke of Tyrconnell's decree respecting
the brass money, and the effects of that deeree in the Williamite as well as the Jacobite quar-
ters ; “ They have cried down the bross money, and have found a way of returning it again
upon us, with vast advantage to themselves, so that we must be forced to cry it down too, or
otherwise it will be left in the Protestants hands, ἃ* they be the loosers; whereas it is now all
in their custody, & they will be the loosers. Resides, it being most part of the currant money
they have amongst them, crying it down in our quarters will destroy all commerce with them,
k consequently prevent their carrying provisions from us to them, which now they daily do,
to their great relief δι support.”

Accordingly, the Williamite government, “ on the ⁴22nd of February following,¹’ says Har-
ris, ‘⁴ intirely took away all currency from the said money²''.
