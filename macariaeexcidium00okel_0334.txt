18th, “ the Irislz Army came‚'' says the same authority, ‘⁴ to the Strand above the WindmiH,
at the South End of Derry hill‚and there stop’d, waiting what Answer or Salutation the City
would give them. The Council had in the mean time given strict Orders that none offer to
tire from the Walls on severe Penalties, and some were seut about the Walls to give lntimation
of it ..... But our Men on the Walls paid so little Deference to either them or their Orders,
and so little regarded the secret 'I‘reaties they were managing with the Enemy, that when
King James's Forces were advancing towards them on the strand, they presently fired their
great Guns at them, and (as was confidently reported) killed one Captain Troy, near the
King's Person. This unexpected Salutation not only struck a strange Terror into the Irislz
Camp, but put the King himself into some Disorder, to find himself so roughly and unman-
nerly treated by those, from whom he expected to find so dutiful a Compliance. And those
who had encouraged him to try an Experinient that proved so dangerous, thought themselves
concern'd to make some Apology for it. The Council therefore resolved to send Arch-dea-
con Hammon to the King, to excuse themselves for what had pass’d, and lay all the Blame of
it on the Ungovernableness of the People, whose violent Humour, they said they could not
restrain, while his Army continued there, and therefore begg'd his Patience, till the present
Tumult was over : And because some of the Council, as well as others, could hardly believe
that King James was really there, Captain ll'lzite was sent with the Arch-deacon (having
often seen the King) to put them out of all Doubt about it. Captain White returned
to them with Assurance of it, but Archdeacon Hamiltou took protectior, (that Summer he
sickned and died.) But King Jumes's being there, was an Argument that had little Force
on our Men on the walls, who were resolv'd to defend the Protestant Religion and King Wil-
lium's Interest, against. him and his Army to the utmost.'‘ Mackenzie then relates how a
Captain Murray, who commanded a considerable party of troops, having entered the town,
and created an insurrection against the Governor Lundie and the City Council, caused
measures to be taken for holding out, instead of giving up, the place.

The Jacobite joui-nal, in its account of the posture of affairs between the King's army and
the garrisom after mentioning that an answer was expected in an hour’s time from the town,
says: ‘¹ Every one was surprised to see that in a little time, that answer was nothing else
than cannon and musquet shots from every side. This continued the rest of the day, and
there were some soldiers killed. In the mean time, several came out of the town that assured
his Majesty, that this only proceeded from the rabble, who being drunk had seized upon the
cannon and fired without order from any people of authority in the town3 that the better
sort were generally resolved to surrender, and did all they could to persuade the common
people to the same. His Majesty,'' continues the journal. in reference to the King having
been requested by his General Officers to return from Charlemont on his way to Dublin,
owing to the influence which they thought his presence before Derry would have, to bring
about the surrender of the place,—“ his Majesty, who had eat nothing all day, had the pa-
tience‚ notwithstanding the fatigue of the two preceding days, to remain on borseback until
the evening, exposed to cannon, and under heavy and incessant rain, waiting for the effects of
