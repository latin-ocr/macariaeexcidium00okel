they came before the Fons, was a serious omission. “An advaneed season in the field is
always fatal to foreigners in this country‚'' says Lieutenant-General Keatinge. And Bishop
But-net, having mentioned how Marlborough‚ on marching to mnsam, “ found the two Forts‚
that commanded the Port, to be so much stronger than the Plans had represented them to be‚'’
adds, ‘⁶ he told me, if he had known their true Strength, he had never undertaken the Expe-
dition, in a Season so far advanced’'‘. See Note ΞΟ, p. 181 3 Note 107, p. 323; Note 112,

Sir Etlwtzrd Seot very gallantly defends the New Fort of Κῖίιεαῖε, in expectation ⁰s being re-
Zieved hy tlze Duke ofBerwick. Causa⁷ of Sir Edward’s not having been relieved hy the
Dulse.

After the storming of the Old Fort of Kinsale on the 3rd of October, “the Lord Marl-
b0›·0ugl1.'‘ says Harris, “having gained this Fort, resolved to make quick work with the New
one, which was much more considerable, being induced by the bad weather, scarcity of provi-
sions, and sickness of his Men, to attach the place briskly, by that method judging he should
lose fewer Men, than by a tedious Siege. Nevertheless‚ he summoned it in form: But Str
Eclward Soet, the Governour, resolutely answered, ‘ It would be time enough to capitulate a
month hence.’'' It held out until the lsth, when the terius of capitulation, for the following
day, were, according to Har-ris, agreed upon, “ about mid-night.”

Colonel O'Kelly's assertion, as to Sir Edward Seot having “held out for 20 Daies‚'' is
therefore incorrect, and the other statement, or that in the Latin version, as to the defence
of Kinsale having been pron-acted “till the Qoth days is likewise wrong. Had the Latin
said “from the 29th day‚'' that is, of September, on which, it has been seen‘, the English
first advanced from Cork to Kinsale, the assertion would be more justitiable.

Of the reasons that prevented the Duke of Berwiek from endeavour-ing to relieve Cork or
Kinsale while besieged by his uncle (at which neglect so much censure appears in the Latin
version l) the Duke gives us this account. ‘¹ J'avois cependant ramasse sept ἂ huit mille hom-
mes &j'avancai du cote de Kilmalock, pour tenter le secours; mais tontes les troupes enne-
mies de ce cote-la l'ayant jointg, je me trouvai εἰ ἰΊιῘῗνίεην en nombre, que je me contentai de
l'observer 3 δε quand sou expedition fut fitne, nous nous retiremes tous dans nos quartiers''¹¹.
This statement of the Duke of Berwick, as to his having been so inferior in number to the
united forces of the Williamites‚ is evident, from a comparison with their accounts.
