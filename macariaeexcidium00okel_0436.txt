When this money first appeared, tlte Proteseants in Dahlz'n seemed reluctant to take z’t, but were
soonforced to do 80, S'c.

“ In this wretched Sort of Money the Popish Soldiers were pald their Subsistence‚‘' ex-
claims the Williamite Harl-is, “ and the Protestant Tradesmen and Creditors obliged to
receive it, for their Goods and Debts ; and it was reasonably eomputed‚'’ he complains, ‘⁶ that
they lost upwards of AE60,000 a Month by this cruel Stratagem !'' But Simon alleges: ‘⁶ Al-
though great part of the copper and brass money was forced on the Protestants, by taking
their goods, and giving them this coin in payment, yet it appears from a Proclamation issued
the 231-(1 of February, 1690, that the Roman Catholic subjecte were far the greater sufferers
by it 3 since, as the Proclamation says⁹ it was found by experience, that they had then in their
possession the whole or the greater part of the said coin.''

A late Irish Protestant historian, Mr. O‘DriscoL in noticing the financial measures of James
and William for the War of the Revolution‚ has these observations, as to the comparative griev-
ances of the Irish Protestants and Roman Catlmlics, from the brass money. ‘⁴ The two KingS,
who divided the British empire at this time, were both driven, by their necessiffies, to schemes of
tinance. William, having been reared in the counting-house of Holland, was the abler con-
triver. He laid the basis of the debt of England by borrowing gold, and pawning the revenue
uf the country to the lender. James did not understand the matter, or could get no one to
lend upon his security3 and the alchemy of banking, or converting paper into gold, was not
yet discovered. But his plan was not very different.

“ James's plan was, to convert (Upper, or other metal of small value, into gold andsilver.
He coined a large quantity of base metal into pieces, upon which he stamped a nominal value,
and made them [ι legal temler for crowns, halferowns, and other silver and gold coin. By his
proclamation, this new coinage was to be received in all dealings, except only in the payment
oftrust-money, or money due on bills, bonds, or mortgages, and except for customs on im-
ported commodities. These exceptions were soon removed—all but the latter.

⁴⁶ James promised, that this coin should, at the end of the war, be received in paynients at
the Exchequer, and exchanged for sterling money. A respectable historiam (Leland) says, that
this plan of finance was against all ‘ law, reason, and humanity‚' and that it has rendered the
name of James ‘horrible to IrIsh Protestants.' It was not against law, because a law was
made for the purpose; and reason and humanity seem to have little to do with financial
schemes. James’s was as good as many of later date. His bank failed undoubtedly, so have
many other banl<s3 but the Protestants did not suffer more by the failure, than people ofother
creeds. The Catholics were far the greatest holders of James’s promissory tokens.

“ James's plan was a copper bank, set up instanter, with an immediate bank restriction.
There might have been, no doubt, an over-issue, but if the Protestants lost, they had least
right of any to complain, for they did all they could to break the banker, and finally suceeeded
