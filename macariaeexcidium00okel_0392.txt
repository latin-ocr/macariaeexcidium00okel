in which the Duke met 1115 death, ‘⁴ That which passed current in the army that day, and
indeed seems most probable was, that he was shot by a trooper, that had deserted from his
own regiment about a year before, and was then in King James's guards.’'

Story gives this character of the Duke : ⁴⁴ He was certainly a Man of the best Education
in the World, and knew Men and Things beyond most of his Time, being· Courteous and
Civil to every Body, and yet had Something always that Iook'd so Great in him, that he com-

manded Respect from Men of 311 Qualities and Stations ...... As to his Person, he was of
a middle stature, well proportion'd‚ fair complectioffd, a very sound hardy Man of his Age,
and sate an Horse the best of any Man; he loved constantly to be neat in his Clothes, and
in his Conversation he was always pleasant: he was fourscore and two when 116 died, and
yet when he came to be unbowelled, his Heart, Intrails and Brains, were as fresh and as
sound, as if he had been but twenty ; so that it's probable he might have lived several Years,
if Providence had not ordered it othe1·ways'' ¹.

So far back as the summer of 1689, when it was decided, that Lauzun should supersede
Rosen in Ireland, the writer of an official letter from France, in the Stuart Papers, who men-
tions 1115 having conversed with Lauzun, on the subject of his destination for lreland, affirma
that Lauzun said: “ If there were a man to whom he wished the greatest plague he could
invent, it should be to be in his circumstances, and to be sent into Ireland. That he was
grown old, and desired quiet 3 and instead of that, undertook a desperate business3 only fit for
somebody who had neither reputation‚ nor interest. 1101· quiet, nor anything else to lose.'’ On
these sentiments of Lauzun, the Jacobite writer adds: ‘⁴ [believe 110 General in France but
would have been ambitious 10 restore the King, and to venture their lives in such a cause.''
By the extract, in Note 126, from Lauzun's despatch ofJuly 26111, 1690, from Limerick, and
still more from the whole os that document, it is evident, he wished to get back to France, as
soon as possible. In Note 43, the existence of a similar feeling, on the part of the French
Officers employed in Ireland, is likewise apparent, by the extract given from Montesquieu.

One of the chief objects of complaint,amongst the French in general, was the difficulty of
supplying themselves here with bread3 which was indispensable 10 their health, though not to
that of the Irish. M. dela Hoguette, one of Lauzun's principal Officers in a letter from Gal-
