whether, against such a superiority in numbers and camon, and opposite such eligible
ground to play artillery from, a river, fordable in so many places, as the Boyne, could be
secured with works at every point by James, with such a force as he had, it would be easy to
decide upon, if this were the place for doing sou.

Of this day's ‘⁶ firing of artillery‚” which was so near settling the whole matter in dispute
hythe death of William, Story says: ‘⁴ Early next Morning (June 30th) our whole Army
lnoved toward the Boyne, making their Approaches very finely. After some time His. Majesty
sent down small Parties of Horse to discover the VVays, and then rid towards the Pass at Old
Bridge, having a full View of the Enemy‘s Camp as he went along; His Majesty stopped
some Time at Old Bridge to obser-ve the Enemy's Posture, and then going a little further,
His Majesty alighted to refresh himself, and sate nigh an Hour upon the Grass3 during
which Time the Enemy brought down two Field-pieces under Covert of a small Party of
Horse, and planted them at the Corner of a Hedge undiscovered3 and when His Majesty,
the Princev, and the Rest were mounted again, and riding softly the smne Way back, their
Cannonier let fly, and at the second Shot was so near killing His Majesty‚ as that the Bullet
slanted upon his Right Shoulder, took away a Piece of his Coat, and struck off the Skin;
which might have been a fatal Blow to his Army, and Kingdoms too, if the Great Creator of
the World, who orders and governs all Things, had not been at his Right Hand, where he
always is, and, Ι hope, will be, as well for the Defence of His Majesty's Sacred Person, as the
Good of those he has undertaken to protect. The Enemy then fired those two Pieces, as fast
as they could charge and discharge, doing some Damage amongst our Horse that were drawing
up before them, which made the King give Orders for his Horse to rein a little backwards,
and have the Advantage of a Rising Ground between them and the Cannon. About Three
a Clock in the Afternoon some of our Field-pieces came up, which were immediately planted,
and then played into the Enemy's Camp: the rest of the Day was spent in our Army's En-
carnping, and in firing Great Guns one upon another from several Batteries, without any
extraordinary Loss.''

James tells us, that it was by lzis order those guns were brought to play upon the Eng-
lish horse, from whose tire William had such a narrow escape of being killed. Having
