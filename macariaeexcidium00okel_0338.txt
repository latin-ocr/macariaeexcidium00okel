ssluclz doubt entertained, (ts to whether, bnt for the interposition ⁰f Louis XI V.'s Amba-§sadum
the Comte d'Avaux, Jomes would restore tlze Iris-h royalists tlzez'r ancient inheritanoes, lost in
his fitther's and brother's service, though the English proprietam, to whom those inheJ-itances
had been transferred, were then z'u open war against lzim.

The royal Memoirs thus state the arguments addueed by the representatives of the dis-
possessed Irish, in favour of their restoration to their properties, through a Repeal of the Act
of Settlement, to which measure the King finally agreed.

‘⁸ It was represented therefore to him on the other hand, what unjust grounds that Act of
Settlement was founded upon, that tho there might have been disorders in the begining of
those troubles in Ireland, the greatest part soon earne to their duty, and were fellow sufferers
with the* King, both at home while the war lasted, and abroad during his banishment, where they
fought his battles and supported his credit; that in consideration of this, King Charles the 2⁶
during his exile, by way of publick treaty or accommodation, acquited them of all clames or
forfeitures on that score3 to which the most Christian King [Louis XIV.] was himselfa witness,
if not a Guarrantee, insomuch that when King Charles the -2‘1 passed the Act of Settlement,
that Prinee expostulated with him by a letter (now published to the world) [for] his recedeing
from so solemn an engagement3 that when the Act was made, there was not time given for
heareing, examffling, and delivering in the clames, whereby many inoeent persons were fore-
closed without being heard ; that tho the Purchasers had a right, it was posterior to the antient
Proprietors, and that in all clames antiquity takes place; besides that the very first adventerers
who certainely had the best title by vertue of the Acts 17⁷ and Is Car: l: in justice and
equity had very little; being the mony which was advanced by them, under that pretence, was
realy employd in raiseing forces in England to fight against the King, and that with the con-
sent of the adventerers themselves as was objected against them at the Treaty of beridg,
that others afterwards advanced their mony only upon votes and ordinanees of the Rebellious
Parliament; that the hardships done to the Irish in the whole proeeeding had been bai-herous
and unhumain, that in the qualifications required to be esteem'd inoeent, any one who had
enjoyd his estate in the enimys quarters, tho he had no ways been aiding to them, was excluded3
so that those who lived quietly were in reality postponed to the rankest Rebells, for it was such
as was then the Possessors3 that the clames of several thousands were never heard, and then
by an Act of explanation debar‘d; and at last to disapoint others, who in spight of all the-
rigours had made out their inocency, or by their signal service abroad had merited justice at
least, they were not to be put in possession, till the present Possessors were reprized out of
lands of equal value, worth and purchass, which the late King Charles was made to believe
might be easily found, but in reality never was: or at least such lands as might have been so
disposed of, the great men, as My Lord of Ormonde, Anglesey, Coot, kingston, &c.‘¹‚ surrep-
