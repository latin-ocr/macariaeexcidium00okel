Clarke, editor of his Memoirs, “ that the essential and lasting service which James rendered
to this Country, in compacting and as it were [1111111100Γ up its Naval Power, has been suffl-
ciently wcighed. It is not generally known, that the Naval Regulations now in force are taken
almost verbatim from those which he established, 01· that when lately the Board of Naval Revi—
sion wished to add to and impl-ove the Nava] Regulations', they sent sor the papers of Pepys,
the Marino Secretary of Jmms, as being the best materials whence they could obtain the object
they had in view. As Campbcll franlrly aclmowledged, ι[1111105 thoronglely 11111l01·.s=cnocltl1e whole

rated hythe honourable testimony of Mr. Secretary Pepys, in his Memoirs; the excellent
methods there recorded, by which James regenerated the Naval Power, clearly show how well
he understood it in all its bearings.” Of James, as Dulze onork, Hume gives this character:
.-‘·Severe but open inhis 0011111105, steadyin his counsels, diligent in his 5011011105, 11111110 111 1115
enterprizes, faithful, sincere, and honourable in his dealings with all mem such was the cha-
racter with which the Duke of York mounted the throne of England'w.

Error as to James's time of life, at tlte birth oflzis son, corrected.

Whatever period between the accession of James II. to the throne, in February, 1683,
and the birth of his first child after that event, or in June, 1688, the text alludes to, it is in-
correct in speaking ofthe King, as only ‘⁴ entering his fiftieth year.¹' James, having been horn
October 14, 1633, was necessarily in 1115 fifty-second year at the period of his coming to the
Crown in February, 1683, and in his fifty-fifth year in June, loss, when his son, style-d the
Pretender, was born, Neverthcless, the King was considered to be of such a sound consti-
tution, that the Irish Roman Catholics looked to his having sufficient time, during his reign,
to make the many political and religious changes in their favour, so earnestly expected from
him. In the copy ofa letter sent to His Majesty, August 14, 1686, which Archbishop King
states to have been found amongst the papers of Dr. Pan-iel< Tyrrell, Roman Catholic Bishop
of Clogher and Kilmore, and Secretary of State in Ireland, the writer observes :-“ And now
that a needful alteration is begun 111 Ireland, it should he carried on speedily for your own
and Catholick subjects· security3 for all the sectaries in England are so gall'd at some of the
phanatielzs being discarded in Ireland, that they join heads, concert councils, swear and
contrive vengeance against all Papists, who must expect no quarters but during your Majesty's

reign :
