In fine, from the main tenor of the preceding evidence, it would appear, that, with the
exception of the fighting on the side of Urrachree, which began, more or less, so early as
between twelve and one o'clock, the general engagement between the two armies did not take
place till about sia: in the evening, and that it lasted for about three Itours before ALL the Irish
were driven from the field, or till about uine in tlte eveniug,—though De la Brune makes the
period of ‘⁴ about three hours'' to have been, from about halfipast six, to about kalf-past nine]-

“ The BatteL'* says the Williamite Seeretary, Davis, “ was chiefly (by reason of the Bogs)
between the Foot on both Sides.”

Deseribing the resistance of the infantry of the Irish right, or Urrachree, wing‚ first at-
taeked upon the renewal of the battle in that quarter by GinkelL about 5 o‘eloek, Story states:
“ A Party of our Foot marched up to their Dite-hes, all strongly guarded with Musketiers,
and their Horse posted advantageously to sustain them : here we fired one upon another for a
considerable Time, and the Irish behaved themselves like Men of another Nationk, defending

¹⁵ Iu opposition to this favourite theory among a
certain class of British writers, as to the Irish being
a people deficient in courage. Story-'s conntryman,
Forman, observes: ‘⁶ The Romans, with an handful
of men, in comparison of the Erimus, conquercd the
greatest part of the island of Britain, and kept pos-
session of it four hundred years. Most of what the
Romans possessed fell afterwards to the share of
the Saxons. The Irish, who were called *S'cots until
the tenth century, likewise conquered North-Bri-
tain, orAlbany, to which they gave the name of Scot-
Inml, and destroyed the Pictis-11 kingdom: Yet no
author ever yet called either the Britons or the Picts

their

cowards, because they lost their country. The Eny-
Iislz were subdued by the Dones, and groaned under
the yoke of tlu·ee‚'‘ (or rather four‚) ‘⁴ successive
Duuislz Kings. They had hardly recovered their
liberty. when the Duke of Narmamly also, with
au army much inferior to King Har-ohl's in number,
conquered all Enylond in one day, and kept it in
bondage until he died. would it be sair, neverthc-
less, in a Daue or a Nurmau, to say, from these
events, that the Enylislz wanted courage, οι· that
they were inx'amous t'or cowardice. whenever they
fought against those nations? Such a proceeding
in them would be to make a satire upon themselves;
since there cannot possibly be any honour acquired
in overcoming a coward. For this reason,'' adds
Forman to his opponent, ‘⁶ you ought to ask pardon
of your countrymen, for the affront you have given
them, in telling the world, it was with α perrel os
mere paltrons, divided amous] themelves, and par—
celleri out into several petly principalitias, that the

judgment, and tumbled you hcadlong into a blun-
