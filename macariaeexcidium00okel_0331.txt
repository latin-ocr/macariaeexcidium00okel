place before the King's arrival, is not the fact. What James says of himself, in reference to
the state of affairs in Ulster, on his coming to Dublin, is as follows: ‘⁵ As soon as he arrived
at the Castle he met with an account from Lieftenant General Hamilton, of his haveing beat
a great body of the Rebells at Drummore, that he had forced them as far as Colrain, and to
the other side ofthe Bau, and had advanced as far as that Towne, but found the Encmy so
numerous and so well intrenched in it, that he durst not attach them, and therefore desired
more troops might be given him to driue them from that River.’' 1Vhereupon, in the royal
council held at the Castie, consisting of the King, the French Ambassador, or Count d'Avaux.
the Duke os Tyrconnell, and the Earl of Melfort, it was debated “ what troops should be
sent to strengthen the camp of Hamilt0n‚ who‚'' observes the Jacobite jourual, ‘⁶ was not
strong enough to take Coleraine, much less to attack Der1·y.'’ The defeat by Hamilton of
the “great body of the Rebells” above mentioned, at what they called “ The Breuis of Drum-
‘moref’ which, says Story, is “ a W'ord common amongst the Irish Scots sor a Rout,'' occurred
on the l4th of March. James's army did not beat the last soree with which the northern
Williamites attempted to keep the field, until the 15th of April, at strabam, Clady-ford, ἃς.
The King did not summon and come before Derry, till the l7th and lSth. Enniskillen,
after the declaration for the Revolution there in December, 1683, was never in the King's
possession. Ballyshannon, too, remained in the hands of the Revolutionists⁴‘.

The King‚ though he praises the conduct ofthe Lord Deputy, TyrconnelL as having done a
“thing very necessary for the safety of Ireland, by disarming the Protestants and seizing
their horses,” adds, ‘⁴ but that too brought inconveniences along with it, and caused so great
disorder, that every Catholique thought himself entitled to pillage the Protestants, and render
back to them the same usage they had before received at their hands.'¹ While such, previous
to the King's arrival in Ireland‚ was the state of the Irish Protestants in the three Provinces
of lreland, that, as containing a population, the great majority of whom were Roman Catho-
lics, had declared against the Revolution, the following, according to Dr. Chai-les Leslie, was
the condition of the Roman Catholics in Ulster, where the protestatus, who were the
stronger party, had formed armed “ Associations” in favour of the Prince of Orange ι “ The
