164 Notes and I llustrcctions.

duly qualified has not bequeathed us a ‘⁴ more copious work,’'like that alludet] to. The present
work is chiefly valuable for the light it throws on the internal politics of the Irish Jacobites;
and, more particularly, for the clear view it presents of the feelings of the old Irish, or great
mass of the people of Ireland, respecting the transactions of those times,—seelings nowhere
0150 so well described. But it is to be lamented, that the Colonel should, though a soldier,
have written so much more on the mere politics, than 011 1110 military occurrences of the three
campaigns, during which he adhered to King James's cause 111 Ι10111οᾱ“’. A “more copious
work‚“ as regards the details of military events on the Irish or Jacohite side, 711031 have ap-
peared the more necessary, from the very erroneous, or one-sided idea, which the Colonel
could not but have ρει-0011011, that the world would be led to form of the conduct of the
King‘s adherents in that war, unless their actions should be made known at length, through
some other medium, than the publications of their opponents ¹¹. And the defect of the
Colonel's present work, as not affording such a relation, must have been the more obvious,
⁴since, in his time, in addition to the knowledge which he himself, as well as so many others
of his countrymen, possessed, respecting the military occurrences of the three campaigns,
there were in existence several accounts in detail of those occurrences, printed and issued
during the war, by King James and his government in Ireland. From such of those ι1110011110
accounts as have come down to us, we see how very few have been the details, regarding those
occurrences, transmitted 111 the Colonel's present work, compared with the particulars which
he miglzt have given.

In the first place, amongst those Jacobite military documents, there was a newspaper
published 10 the 111511 metropolis, under the appellation of The thhlin Gazette, as we find
from the following sentence in some intelligence of the day, printed in London, about the
month of April, 1689, upon a broad-sheet‚ and purporting to be the contents osa letter from
a correspondent in Dublin. “ There is,'' says the Williamite writer, in this broad-sheet. “no

⁰ Mr. Hardiman has cited a similar remark, as to
the injurious effects of mere politics 00 1110 trans-
mission of facts, from Bishop Fleetwood, in con-
nexion with the subject of his useful work, the
Clzronicon preciosum. Having noted that, for
sorty years before the close of the fifteenth cen-
tury. he was unable to collect the prices of commo-
dities in Englaud from any of her writers in those
days. and also observed, that the same remark was
applicable to forty years more. the learned prelate
adds, in reference to those writers: “Our chroni-
clers wanted the care aud observation of their pre—
decessors; and, setting up for politicians, quite ne-
glected (as they thought them) Iesser matters.'‘--

²¹ During the preceding war 10 Ireland, or that

against the Parliamentarians, a letter is giren by
Rushworth, as directed by Bonaventure O‘ Conney,
from St. Isodore's College, at Rome, to Sir Phe·
lim O’Neill, in which the 1111111)Υ of regular. written
accounts, on the side of the Irish (as well as their
enemies) is thus advocated: ‘⁸ I would advise every
chief officer among you to have a secretary along
with him, to write a diurnal of your passages. and
the overthrows your enemies receive, which will
redound much to your 7ξζ]01“)·.” There is such a
‘¹ dim-nal,‘’ or journar of mat period, yet extant;
but, for the War of the Revolution, we have πο
production at all to compete, in point of detail, on
the Jacobite side, with Story's work on the Wil-
liamite side.--(Moore’sHisto1·y οἰ 11013011, vol. iv.
