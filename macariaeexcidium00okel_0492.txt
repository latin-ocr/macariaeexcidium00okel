On the battle of Aughrim, in connexion with the fall of St. Ruth.William III.'s bio-
grapher and zealous Anglo-Irish partisan, Hamis, states, from the result of his researches
into official, as well as other sources of information: “ It must in justice be confessed, that
the Irislz fought this sharp battle with great resolution ; which demonstrates, that the many
defeats before this time sustained by them cannot be imputed to a national eowardice‚ with

The late Lieutenant-General Keafinge, whose opinion on this point, as that of a practieal
soldier, may he useful, in his critical comments upon the battle of Aughrim, thus speaks of the
circumstances in which he considered St. Ruth and his army to have been, when he was 513111,
&c- ‘¹ St. Ruth, to whom the appearance of Ginkle's right wing of cavalry, so near his line,
was a surprise, not expecting to have had both his flanks attacked‚ was bringing up a reserve
of cavalry, for the purpose of falling on Ginkle's right, when he was killed by 3 cannon shot.
This fortunate shot probably caused the gaining the battle. St.Ruth had the advantage upon
the right, where the first attack had been made. Ginkle's infantry were exhausted, by wading

thro* a bog up to their middles 3 they had been driven back into that bog with loss and con-
fusiom and St. Ruth was at that moment coming down upon their right flank, with a fresh
body of cavalry. Sofar every thing was in hissavor'. But St. Ruth communicated with no

k It has already been repeatedly shown, in these
notes, that a no less important cause than any above
specified by Hau-ris contributed to the reverses of
the Irish, viz.. their great inferiority in pay, ap-
pointments‚ small arms, artsslery, and effective num-
bers, to the English, Scotoh, Anglo-Irish, Dutch,
Dauish, German, Huguenot, δια, troops of the line

opposed to them, as well as the very efficient local
Williamite militia, 01· yeomanry, in which Han-iss
own father, Hoptou Harris, served. Consult, as
to the amount of these regulars of so many nations,
and that of their domestic assistants, Sco, Note

¹ It may be remarked of this conclusion, that the
gallant author would appear to have arrived at it
merely through Williamite accounts, since, from 3
general perusal of his strictures on the campaigns
of this war, he seems to have had such documents
only before him.
