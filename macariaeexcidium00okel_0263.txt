of Eumenius he verifies by the transcription of the original passage from that writer, as to
the Southern Britons having, before their invasion and subjection hy Rome, been habitually

order to arrest the predatory incursions of the Picts and their Irish or Dalriadic neighbours

Britain and Gaul, of the Scots, or Irish. These expeditions were generally, or as regards
Britain, undertaken in connexion with the Picts, at other times in conjunc-tion with the l'icts
