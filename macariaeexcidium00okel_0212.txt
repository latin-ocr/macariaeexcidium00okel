Charles I. tried and exeeuted in Englancl, to tlte great regret osche Irislt.

Cox, in his work on Ireland‚ thus expresses himself, under the year 1649, respecting the
execution of Charles I. at Whitehall :—“ And now how gladly would Ι draw a cnrtain over
that dismal and unhappy 30th of J anuary, when the royal father of our country suffered mat·-
tyrdom. Oh! that I could say they were Irish men that did that abominable fact, or that
Ι could justly lay it at the door of the Papists !'’ Mac Geoghegan, who, writing as a Roman
Catholic priest, and one of the old Irish. speaks in different terius, though with equal abhor-
rence, of the King's execution, and observes, on this amusing wish of the then ex-Recordex· of
Kinsale, and subsequent ChiefJustice of the Court of Common Pleas, and Lord Chaueellor of

owing to the supremacy of the Independent sect or faetion, represented by the army ; and as
it was to this ascendancy of the military the King's execution was attributable, so was his death
followed, not by a popular, or democrafflc, but by a military system of goverument3 assuming,
under the name of a republie or eommonwealth, to represent the power of the peopleR

Misstatement respectz'ng General Owen Roe O‘Nez‘ll refuted.

It is very strange, how any one could have laboured under such a misapprehension, as to
affirm, that the Irish were, through Owen Roe O'Neill's ‘¹ unhappy generzssship, completely
overthrown, and defeated with enormous slaughter!'’ General Owen Roe O'Neill was never
