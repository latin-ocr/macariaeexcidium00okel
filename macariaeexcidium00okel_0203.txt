Lords Justices for Ireland, as matters, on account of which, it was most necessary to satisfy
the Irish, in the conditions of the Proelamation, directed by william to be issued, for the
purpose of terminating the Irish war. The manuscript letter of those Lords ι1115111305, 111 the
State Paper Office, London, dated Dublin, May 29, 1691, and in the handwriting of Lord Co-
ningeshy, after showing the necessity there was for the very favourahle tenor of ‘¹ the inclosed
Proclamation,'' with respect to the Irish (“ His Majesty having, ye last post, by letter from
Lord Portland, sent orders to ye Generalli, upon any terms to bring ye Irish to a submissioffl),
argues, that the conditions in question, however they might be objectvd to as “ very large,''
ought not to be made less so; because, adds the document, ‘⁶ sinse they (1110 lrish) are a people

fluence over the people, than any where els in ye world.'' In the manuscript letter of the
same Lords Justices to Lieutenant-General Ginkell‚ from Dublin Castie, July 13, 1691, in
the handwriting of Secretary John Davis‚ and amongst the MSS. of Trinity College, Dublin,
it is again stated by those Lords Justices, that they availed themselves of every allowable means
to render the Proclamation acceptable to the 1rish, on the score of their religion, since the
preservation of that religion was to them an object of such paramount importance ;-*ι Α5 to

The version in the text, of the commencement of the Scottish monarchy in Britain by
colonists from 1reland, adopts the story os the occurrence of that event under an imaginary
Fergus, asserted, by an apocrypha] class of Scotcla historians, to have lived about 330 years
before Christ, and to have been succeeded by from forty to forty-five king-s, now agreed to
have no more reigned in Scotland, than their fabied predecessor. This system of antedating
the origin of the Scottish monarchy, which was but too long attempted to be imposed upon the
world as a portion of Scotch history, took its rise from the disputes about the right of succes-

founded upon a fabulous pedigree of ancient kings on the English side, could, in an 1111011-
lightened age, be controverted by no better means, than a counterlist of imaginary princes on
the Scottish side. The first authentic settlement in North Britain of the Irish,—or, as they
