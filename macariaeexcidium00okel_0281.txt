dent in their demands and their refusals. Lofty in promise, poor in execution : adulation and
calumny, perfidy and treason, are the familiar arts of their policy.'’

Gibbon, in connexion with this ‘⁶ dark portrait‚’‘ of which, he says, “the features, however
harsh and ugly, express a lively resemblance of the Romans of the twelfth century‚'' observes,
that “ Gregory VII.‚ who may be adored or detested as the founder of the papal monarchy,
was driven from Rome, and died in exile at 5111811111.Π He adds, that “ six and thirty of his
(Grcgory's) successors, till their retreat to Avignon, maintained an unequal contest with the
R01nans‚'' in which “their age and dignity were often violated, and the churehes, in the solemn
rites of religion, were polluted with sedition and murder.'' Then, after affirming, that, as ‘⁴ a
repetition of such capricious brutality, without connexion or design, would be tedious and dis-
gusting,” it would suffice to give “ some events of the twelfth century, which represent the
state of the Popes and the city,'' he commences with instancing the barbarous violence of the
Romans towards Paschal 11., who occupied the papal chair from 1099 to 1118. “ 011 Holy
Thursday, while Paschal officiated before the altar, he was interrupted by the clamours of
the multitude, who imperiously demanded the confirmation ofa favourite magistrate. His
silence exasperated their fury: his pious refusal to mingle the affairs of earth and heaven
was encountered with menaces and oaths‚ that he should be the cause and the witness of the
public ruin. During the festival of Easter, while the bishop and the clergy, barefoot and
in procession‚ visited the tombs of the martyra they were twice assaulted at the bridge of
St. Angelo, and before the Capitol, with volleys ofstones and darts. The houses of 1115
adherents were levelled with the ground: Paschal escaped with difficulty and danger: he
levied an army in the patrimony of St. Peter; and his last days were embittered, by suffering
and inflicting the calamities of civil war,’' The historiari then mentions, how ‘¹ the scenes that
followed the election ofhis (Paschal's) successor, Gelasius the Second,'' who was Pope from
1118 to 1119, “were still more scandalous to the cliurch and city. Cencio Frangipani. a
potent aud factious baron, burst into the assembly, furious and in arms: the cardinals were
stripped, beaten, and trainpled under f00t; and he seized, without pity or respect, the vicar
of Christ by the throat. Gelasius was dragged by his hair along the ground, buffeted with
blows, wounded with spurs, and bound with an iron chain, in the house ofhis 111-111111 tyrant.
An insurrection of the people delivered their bishop : the rival families opposed the violence
of the Frangipani 3 and Cencio, who sued for pardon, repented of the failure, rather than of
the guilt, of his enterprize. Not many days had elapsed, when the Pope was again assaulted
at the altar. While his friends and enemies were engaged in a bloody contest. he escaped in
his sacerdotal garments. Ι11 this unworthy flight, which excited the compassion of the Roman
matrons, his attendants were scattered or unhorsed 3 and, in the fields behind the Church of
St. Peter, his successor was found alone, and half dead with fear and fatigue.’· Gibbon adds,
that ⁴⁶ shaking the dust from his feet,” Gelasius “ withdrew from a city, in which his diguity
was insulted, and his person was endangered ;” and, in reference to Lucius II., who was Pope
from 1144 to 1145, and Lucius HL, who was Pope from 1181 to 1185, he says :—“ The
former, as he ascended in battle array to assault the Capitol, was struck ou the temple by a
