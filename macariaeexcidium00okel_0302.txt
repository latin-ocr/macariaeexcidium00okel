Much lar-ger land-force, than generally related, brought by Henry I Ῑ . to I reland.

If, according to the text, report in Ireland greatly exaggerate& history, as hitherto written,
has much underrated, the amount of the force, with which Henry embarked for this country iu
October, 1171. The late learned Mr. William Lynch, after observing, in reference to the cir-
cumstances of the first “ English settlement” effected in Ireland by Henry II.‚ that ‘⁴ our in-
formation on this subject may be gathered from the well-considered language of legal records,
instead of the imperfect, contradictory‚ and, indeed, too often erroneous, statements of anna-
lists and historians‚” says: “ Amongst the original muniments above alluded to, perhaps few
now remaiu more illustrative of the principal laws of England than the ancient Pipe Roll of
the year 1171 preserved in Somerset House. By this document we find, that King Henry
the Second, when about making his voyage royal into Ireland in that year, proclaimed scutage
throughout his dominions: in consequence, all those holding in capite under the Crown by
military service were bound to accompany the King in his expeditions, and, if not proceeding
in person, were bound to send so many knights, or to make pecuniary compensation‚ in pro-
portion to the service due out of the estates which they held under the Crown.'' Then.
noting how the English clergy, as well as the laity, were subject to this tax, he adds : ‘¹ The
purposes to which this money was applied by the King, or, under his orders, by the venerable
Randulph de Glanvilla, are set forth on the Roll, and the principal payments seem to have
been made for the arms, provisions, and shipping of the army, which, mcmericolly,from those
payments, we can perceive, fitr exeeeded the soree described z'n our printed historiam-:¹

As to the strength of Henry'sfleet,—from which, if correctly given by the Anglo-Nor-
man chroniclers, Mr. Lynch's suspicion, as to the amount of the king's land-force having been
much greater than is generally represented, would appear still more probable,—Dr. O'Conor
states: “ Auctores Angli inquiunt in Hiberniam cum 400 navibus navigasse.
