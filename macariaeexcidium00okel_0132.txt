Ercidium fllacarioe; or,

to reject it3 then, and not before, it began to decline. But that which
under-valued it most, was the little Esteem the great Ones about Court
shewed for it; Cort'a'on’s Lady comonly giveing Double the Quantity of
Brass‚ for soe much Silver. This made the inferior Sort to vilify the
Coyne; especially after the Defeat of Amasis on the River of Lapideus,
it became so despicable among the Cypriane, that the Comodity which
might be purchased for one Peice of Silver would eost 20 in Brass3 and
yet Coridon, and those who governed under him, extortcd from the
Country People theire Goods at the King's Rate, when he paid in Silver.
But the Oppression that the poor Cypriam Merchants lay under, in the
Cityes of Paphos and Cythera, (for the Com'donians had noe more to
manage‚) was most insufferable. A Factor, who had his Goods ready to
be brought on Board a Vessell hired to that Purpose, must have the
Affliction to behold his VVarehouse broke open, and all that intended
Freight (which he acquired with soe great Pains and Expenee) snatched
fron] him in a Moment‚ for which he had the Value g1ven him in Cop-

Cyprii mercatores onerabantur in urbibus Papho, Cszstlzaertiqae, quas solas C'o-

ductae naves in portu stabant, mercesque ad exportandum paratae, non sine
ingenti animorum vexatione intuebantur tabernas violenter effringi, et for-
tunas omnes, quos tanto labore tantaque cura coacervaverant, momento tem-

numerabantur aera prout auro aut argento talia prius venibant, quibus ne
vilissima quidem rerum alias inter nationes comparare possent. Et quan-
