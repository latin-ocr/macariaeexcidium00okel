they returned the like? &e- Then the Williamite Major gives the result of this movement‚ and
of the battle in general, in his letter, remarking in the postscript: “ One thing in the above
is observable, which is, that if the dragoons had obeyed their orders, and not have flred and
fallen upon the enemy, which was positively against the General's orders, the battle had not
been. Such small accidents sometimes hazard great bodies”2.

The Irislz, encouraged by the presence and conductos Sc. Ruth, kept their ground, and beat the
English, as often as they advanced towards them.

The contemporary Williamite letter in the Rawdon Papers, from ‘⁶ Dublin‚ the 15th July,
169l,·' to Narcissus Luttrel, Esq., commencing, “ On this moment we have, by an express from
the Gener-al, the happy and blessed news, that on Sunday night, the leth instant, our army
engaged the 1rish‚·· δια, observes upon the obstinacy of the contest: “ The combat lasted with
great bravery near 3 hours 3 our men being obliged to attack them fron] trench to trench,
which they had thrown up for their advantage, having a bog on both sides to cover them.
Never was an attack made with more bravery and courage, and never was it known that the
Irish fought with more resolution.''

King James's Memoirs assert, on the resistance of his army to the English z ‘¹ The Irish
considering that this was like to proue the last effort for restablishing the King's authority,
and secureing the estates and liberties of an oppressed people, expected them with great con-
stancy, and convinced the English troops, they had to doe with men no less resolute than
themselves 3 so that never was assault made with greater fury, or sustain'd with greater obsti-
nacy, especially by the foot, who not only mentain'd their posts and defended the hedges with
great valour, but repulsed the enemie several times, particularly in the center, and took some
prisoners of distinctiom in so much that they looked upon the victory as in a manner certain,
and S¹ Ruth was in a transport of joy to see the foot of which he had so mean an opinion
behaue themselves so well, and performe action worthy of a better fate.”

Mac Geoghegan adds, respecting this delight of the Freneh General, and the cause ofit:
‘⁴ L'infanterie royale fit des prodiges de valeur, elle poussa trois fois celle des ennemisjusqu⁷2i
leur ennom δε on pretend qu'a la troisieme fois Ie General Saint-Ruth en fut si content, qu'il
jetta en l'air son chapeau pour exprimet* sajoie.''

On the same points, thus spoken of by the King and the Jacobite Abb‘e, the Williamite
Chaplain‚ Story, alleges: ‘⁴ Mons. St. Ruth, when he first saw our Foot in the Centre repulsed,
in a great Ecstasy, told those next him, that lle wou'd now beat our Army back to tlte Gates of
Dubliw·
