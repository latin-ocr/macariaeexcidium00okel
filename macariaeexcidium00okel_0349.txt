reasonably enough propose to himself that he might obtain his Liberty of Coum Sclwmberg,
upon his Parol, to go to Dublin, where he might have better Accomodation for his Cure, and
theuto return Prisoner.'' Such a permission, however, was not obtained. The same document
thus adverts to the escape of Lord Mountcashel from Enniskillen, and to the gratifying nature
of the circumstance to the Irish Jacobite government, in connexion with the defeat of Μαι-51131
Schonberg's design to subdue Ireland, in the campaign of 1689.-“ To add full Measure of
Grief to the Retiremeut of this General, amidst all the Frustrations of his Designs, my Lord
Δ’1101ιηῐι“ιιεΙιε>Ζ,” says the account, ‘¹ most ingeniously wrought his own Deliverance from his
Continement at Iniskilling, being pretty well recovered ofhis Wounds, and came to the King at
the Castle of Dublin, with several Officers and 0111615, from the Enemyv on Tnesrlay, the 17th
of December (1689), where 1115 Lordship was very kindly received hy the Kiug with a hearty
Wkdcome, and Carressed by all the Great Officers and others his Friends, with all Demonstra-
tions of Joy and Gladness imaginable.”

Story represents the circumstances of Lord Mountcashel's escape as follows: ‘⁶ Towards
the latter End of December, Major Genera] Macharty made his Escape from Innzlwkillin, who
had remained there a Prisoner ever since the Rout at Newtozmz-Butler ; he had been Sick, and
at that Time writ to Major General Ksrk to get Leave of the Duke (Schonberg> to have his
Guard removed, which he complained of was troublesome in his Sickness, this was (lone ς but
at his Recovery (they say) a Sei-jeant and some Men were put upon him again. The Town it
seems stands upon a Lough, and the W‘ater came to the Door of the House where he was con-
flned, or very near it. He found Means to corrupt a Serjeant, aud so got two small Boats,
called Cotts, to carry him and his hest Moveables off in the Night. The Serjeant went along
with him, but returned that Night to deliret· a Letter, which, and lllachurty's Pass, being found
in the Lining of his Hm, he was the next Day shot for it. The General (Schonberg) was much
concerned when he heard of Illuclearty‘s Escape,'' continues Story, “ and said he took him lo
be α illan ofllunour, but he would 1ιυί expect tlmt in (ιη Irislz Man any more. Col. IImniHon,
the Governour of Iunislcillz‘n, was blamed for this Negligence, but he came to Lisburn and
desired 11. Tryal, which could not be for Want of Fit-ld Officers, till the l5tlz of flIczrclz, at what
Time he produced Major General Kirlrs Letter to him, by which he was cleared.'’

Harris, who had local, or Enniskillen manuscript, as well as other, sources of iiitelligencc,
for his information on this matter, having stated how Lord Mountcashel, after being brought
a prisoner to Enniskillen, was ¹⁶ there allowed the liberty of the town, upon his pa1·ole‚''.spcul<s,
in this manner, of his Lordship‘s escape. “ After some time, finding but little prospect of
being ransomed or exchanged‚ he artfully caused a rumour to be spread, that he intended to
make his escape: Whereupou the Governour (of Enniskillen) put him under a Guard, and by
doing so, releused ltimfrom his parole. The Guard, reflecting on the freedom, with which he
had been indulged, were remiss enough; and Serjeant Acheson, being bribed‚ carried him off
in the nightby water, for which he was shot the next day.'' Lord MountcasheL after 1115 arrival
in Dublin in December, 1689, remained in lreland till his departure for France, in the Spring
of 1690, along with the Irish Brigade, appointed to go there, instead of the French troops,
