small Resemblance with several] Passages in that History,
which gave me the Curiosity to translate it out os Syriae into
the Latin Tongue, and perhaps I had the Vanity to believe
that my Labour would not be ungratefull to others, and espe-
cially to you, courteous Reader, to whom I now present it.

2. The Author was Plzylotas, for the singular Love he bore
his Country comonly calleci Philo-Cyprea His Extraction by
the Father of an antient Cypriam Family, and by the Mother
of an old Ciliciam Race, made him equally concerned for both3
and his being an Eyewitness of the most memorable Actions
happeuing in the Island of Cyprus 111 1115 own Time, renders
the Authority of his Writeing unquestionable. He compiled
this short Treatis soon after the Conquest of his Country and

usurpaverit, eorumque eventuum, qui aut gloriam apud posteros, aut in-
famiam mererentur, praesens testis fuerit, scriptis euni suis, indubitatae
veritatis authoritatem acquisivisse par 051. Hanc Epitomen vergentibus
jam in senium annis, et sub luctuosum illud Patriae excidium composuit,
ne inclementi fatorum lege praereptus majus 01 uberius opus, quod animo
meditabatur, posteritatis memoriae commendare 11011 posset.
