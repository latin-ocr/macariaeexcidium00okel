Small proportion to which Roman Catlzolics were reduced in Englaml, as compared with Protes-
tants oftlie Established Clzzcrclz, aad Dissenters, at tlze period oftlze Revolueion.

How nearly the “ Roman Catholic rites'' were “ exploded⁰ in England in those days, or,
in other words, how “few and weak'’ were the members of that religion there in William's
time, when compared with those of other persuasions, would appear from an inquiry which the
King caused to be instituted on that point, for the entire kingdom, under the two divisions of
the Province of Canterbury, and the Province onork. The paper embodying the results of
that inquiry was placed by William in his chest, and has been very properly copied and pub-
lished by Dalrymple, in his appendix. Under the head of the ‘⁶ The number of Freeholders
in England‚’' that document says, there were, within the province of Cantcrbury, 2,]23,362
Conformists, οι· members of the Established Churoh; 93‚]51 Non-ConformistS, or Protes-
tant Dissenters3 and but 11,878 Roman Catholics: while, for the province of York, there
were 353,89-2 Churchmen ; l5,5-25 Dissenters ; and only 1978 Roman Catholics. There
were, consequently‚ in both provinces, under the head of “ F1·eeholders,'' 2‚4T7.254 Church.
men3 108,6T6 Dissenter53 οι· 2,.585,930 Protestants of all kind53 and only 13‚856 Roman
Catholics—“ the Conformists and Non-Conformists together, to Papists.” says the document,
being in the proportion of 1863. In fine, after setting forth at length the several data or de-
tails for this estimate, it arrives at the conclusion, that the Roman Catholics of the province
of Canterbnry, ‘⁴ fitt to bear arms,'’ being no more than 4239, and those of the Province of
York only 701, ‘⁶ the total of the Papists throughout England fitt to bear arms'' would be but
4940 persons''⁰.

The author, in his allusion to a Milesian colonization of Ireland from Spain, seems to fol-
low the account of O'Flaherty, the author of Ogygia. That writer, aster nwting that, du-
ring David's reign over the Hebrews, ‘⁸ Golam, Miles Hispanicus, Milesi-irum regum Hiber-
niae Sator, fl01·uit,” adds, respecting the testimony given by the Irish narratives relative to
the colony alleged to have been brought by the sons of Golam, or Milesius, into this country:

Scotorum ex Hispania in Hibernia appulsum'’‘¹.
