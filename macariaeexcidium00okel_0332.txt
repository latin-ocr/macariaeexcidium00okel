Irish there,'' says Leslie‚ ‘⁶ were in mortal Fear of the Protestants, and commonly durst not
sleepe in their Hmrses, but lay ahroad in the Fields least they should fall upon them: No
Irish were suffered to live in the Country who did not take out Prote-ctions from such of the
Protestaut Gentry as were allowed by the Ass-oviators to grant such Protections : Nor durst
they Travel from their own Houses without Passes. The Protestmzts made them eontribute
equally, at least, with themselves in all their new Levies, and forced them to work upon their
new Fortifications, at their Pleasure, which they did without grudging, and any thing to
please those who were absolutely their Masters, and in whose Hands they reekoned their Lives
to lye every Moment; and many Insults and Threatnings they hore from the Commonality of
the molesmum, who made full Use of their finding themselves at Liberty from all Government,
:md to domineere over those who were intirely at their Mercy.'’ The Doctor, elsewhere,
speaking of this part of Ireland, “where the Protestants were many more in Number, and
all up in Arms‚” adds, that this they “ chiefly pretended to be in Odium to the Irish Papists,
whom they called Bloody Dogs, Inltmnane Murtlzerers, Cut-tlzroats, &c., and Remember 41,
which was the usual Salutation they gave them.''

With respect to James's efforts for the protectior] of his Protestant subjects in the North,
the same authority, writing in 1692 (the year after the conclusion of the War of the Revo-
lution in Ireland)‚ says : ‘⁶ As many Protestants as staid at Home, and trusted themselves to
King James's Protection, preserved their Goods and Improvements, and live now plentifully3
while those that fied from him lost what they had, and smart now severely under these Ne-
cessities, which their Neighbours escaped, who either would not, or could not, fly from the
Met-oy of their Natural Sovereign. * * ⁸ * The Irish Protestants who staid in Ireltzntl while
King James was there, will attest the Truth of whatI have said. 1 appeal to Thomas Pottinger
Esq ; who was then Savereign of Belsitst, the greatest Town of Trade in the North os Irelund,
whether upon his Application to King James, his Majesty did not give him Proteetion after
Protection for Belfimt and the Country about? And whether such Protections were not made
good to them by King James's Officers? and where any of the Irish offered to transgress
against the said Protections, they were not severely punished, upon the first Application to
the King, or those commanding under him.

“ This is likewise attested by Colonel John ΗίΖῘ, present Governor of Fort- William at In-
nerloclzy in scotland, but living at that time in Belfust, in his Letter from Beh‘hst to the Sove-
reign of Belfizst, then in Dublin, (inserted No. ⁶25, Appeucliir), and which Letter he desires
the Sovereign to shew to none, and therefore spoke his Mind in it, and not to flatter the
Government. There he tells how well Grievanees were reclressed‚ and King James's Army
kept to strict Disciplina

‘¹ 1 demand further, Whether the same Mr. Pottinger did not, upon his Application to King
James, obtain leave for the Merchants odefast, and of the Country about, to return from
Scotland, and other Places whither they had fied, even after the Time limited by His Majesties
Proclamation for their Return? And whether, upon a second Application to His Majesty, and

representing that there was an Embargo on the Scots side, King James did not grant them
