stated how on the 30th‚ (the next day after the Irish army had passed the river,) the enemy
appeared and drew up opposite them on the other side, “their foot over against old bridg, and
the1r left towards Droghedagh,'' the royal Memoirs add, “their right wing of hors was so
near the river on a high ground, that the King made some of his Cannon advance between his
camp and old bridg, which so gald that wing, as obliged them to quit their post and encamp
behind the Eminence out of sight; it was there‚'' observes the King, ‘⁴ the Prince of Orange
was touched onthe shoulder by one of the first two shots, which just setched off the skin and
did him no further prej udices then ΜΓ. Coningesby (subsequently one of the Lords Jus-
tices of Ireland) rode up, and put his handkerchief upon the wounded part, William is said by
Bishop Kennet, to have merely observed, “There is no Necessity, the Bullet should have

The King ceusured, sor sending εαηηυη away, che nightpreceding the aetion, towards Dublin.

In Note 123, it has been shown, that James is related to have had no more fbrmidable artillery
at the Boyne than twelve field-pieces‚ against from fifty to sixty large carmon, besides field—mor-
tars. The King kept no more than six pieces with him for action, which he had with his left wing,
against the English right, towards Slane. James's lnotive sor sending away the rest, with the
baggage, to Dublin, may have been, that as but six light guns could be ofso little avail against
such a very superior artillery as that of the enemy before Old-Bridge, and as those six light
pieces could thus effect nothing there to compensate for the risk of their being dismounted or
taken, it would consequently be most prudent, not to be without at least six piet-es of field artil-
lery, in case the other six should be lost. But, howsoever this may have been, the passages in
James's Memoirs, relative to the removal of his baggage and a portion of his artillery, are as
follow. Spealzing of the 30th of June, or the day before the engagement at the Boyne, it is
said: “the King believeing they (the enemy) might march by their right up towards Slane to
pass the river there, or endeavour to force the ford at old bridg, he order’d the baggage to
be loaden, and be ready to march that the ground might be clear on which it camped by morn-
ing.'’ Observing how, the following morning, at sun-rise, the enemy's right wing was seen to
⁸· march towards Slane followed by a line of foot‚'' it is added, ‘⁴ upon which the King order'd
the left to march up likewise on the other side the water, and the baggage towards Dublin
with all the cannon but six which were directed to follow the left wing.’' ln reference to
‘⁶ the two first brigades of the first line drawn up before old bridg,‘’ it is remarked by the
King, “ from which post he did not think fit to draw them, the Cannon and baggage not being
far enough advanced on their way towards Dublin.·'
