Esq., of Gallagh, County Galway), but one son, Denis; already mentioned, as a
Captain of Horse in the Irish army, at the battle of Aughrim. Both the father
and the son having been in Limerick when the Treaty took place, and the family
estate being consequently preserved, the Captain, on his father's decease, became
tenth lord of the manor of Screen. Under a suspicion of planning to restore
the House of Stuart, on which was founded a charge of high treason‚ he was,

sister to the Earl of Strafford, and Maid of Honour to Mary of Este, Queen of
James II.‚ had two daughters. To the elder of these, Lady Mary Bellew, Cap-
tain Denis O'Kelly was married, November ist, 1702. Her fortune was AE16‚000;
