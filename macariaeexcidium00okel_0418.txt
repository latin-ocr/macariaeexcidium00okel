This was the Castle of Birr, the family residence of Sir Lawrence Pzzrsons, ancestor to
the present Earl of Rosse. “ Tireonel‚·’ says the Duke of Berwick, “ m'avoit laiss& le com-
mandement general du Royaume en son absence: sur quoi ayant envie d'etendre mes quartiers
au dela de la riviere de Shannon, je passai au pont de Banaker avec toute ma cavalerie, sept
bataillons‚ ὃς quatre pieces de canon; j'attaquai le chateau de Blir: mais par la maladresse de

and fastnesses, and were resolved to attack them3 but Sui-sfield saved them that labour, by
retiring hastily to a place of more security beyond the Shannon‘. The principal design of
this expedition was upon the Bridge of Bannaglzem but the attempt to break it down was found
too hazardous at that time, not only as the enemy was very strong on the other side, but as it
