wholly from their· sight ..... With so clear and deep a sense os the great value of the pos-
session, there can hardly be a more convincing pr00f‚ that the Romans considered its conquest,
not easy, than the simple fact that they never attempted it 3 and that, though Britain continued
to be harassed by the lrish, for near three centuries after, not a single Roman soldier ever
set foot on their shores. Even when the flight of their eagles had extended as far as the
Orcades, Ireland still rernained free.

“ How little the Irish themselves were in fear ofinvasion at this very period, when, as Taci-
tus informs ns, the coast opposite to their shores was lined with Roman troops, may be judged
from the expedition to Britain, undertaken hy their Monarch Crimthan, for thc purpose of
aiding his ancient allies, the Picts, in their heroic stand against the legions of Rome. In
the course os this visit, the Irish Monarch is said to have first set the example of those pre-
datory incursions into the Roman province, hy which the Britons so long after continued to
be molested; and having been, as it appears, eminently successful on this occasion. he re-
turned to his dominions laden with a variety of rich and even luxurious booty, the particulars
of which have been triumphantly enuinerated by the annalists. ln the long list of articles
specified by the Four Mmsters, as composing this mass of plui-ider, are mentioned a suit of
armonr, ornamented with embossed gold and genis, a military cloak with golden fringe, a
sword with figures of serpents upon it in chased gold, and a brace of greyhounds, joined tage..
ther by a silver chain, whose price is estiinated, according to the prisnitive usage ofbarfflr,
at the value of 300 cows.''

According to the same usage in the heroic age of classic poeti-y, Homer, it may be ob-
served, states the price of Diomede's brazeu arniour at nine, and that of Glaucus's golden
amnour at a hundred oxene.

cbrztinual hostilities of tlze ancient Irislz (tmongst themselves—as in other natium, to a compara-
tively recent period.

For the continual hostilities which existed between the aboriginal Irish, like all other
nations in a primitive, clannish‚ or feudal state of society, see the Annals of the Four Masters,
from the earliest period, down to the final reduction of Celtic Ireland beneath the British
sceptre, in the reign of James Ι. On the bad effects of the social and political system in an-
cient Ireland, both as productive of those wars, and of the still more injurious consequences
ultimately flowing from them, Mr. Moore remarks:—“ One of the worst results, indeed, of
that system of law and govermnent under which lreland first started into political existence,
and retained, in full vigour of abuse, for much more than a thousand years, was the constant
obstacles which it presented to the growth of a. public national spirit, by separating the mass
cf the people into mutnally hostile tribes, and accustoming each to merge all thought of the

general peace 01· welfare in its own factious views‚ or the gratification of private revenge.''
