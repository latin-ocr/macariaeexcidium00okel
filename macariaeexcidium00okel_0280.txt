Were we to judge of the general state ofreligion amongst the Romans of the twelfth cen·
tut-y hy the historical accounts given oftheir conduct, it would appear to be no great compliment
to the lrish in general to say, there was not, ‘⁸ at that time, in all the globe‚ not eren Rome itxetf‘,
a spot where the heavenly powers were more religiously adored, and the Roman Catholic rites
more purely and sincerely celebrated, than in the island of Ireland.'’ Gibbon, after observing
os those numerous strangers who visited Rome for religious purposes, how “their expenses,
sacred or profane, circulated in various channels for the emolument of the Romans‚'' and how
‘⁵ such powerful motives should have firmly attached the voluntary and pious obedience of the
Roman people to their spiritual and temporal father,’' nevertheless relates, “ that the shrine
of St. Peter was profaned hythe thoughtless Romans, who pillaged the offerings and wounded
the pilgrims, without computing the number and value of similar visits, which they prevented
by their inhospitable sacrilege.‘' He further remarkS‚ that “ among the nations who revered
the apostolic throne, the tumults of Rome provoked a general indignation‚'' and that, “ in a
letter to his disciple Eugenius ΙΙΙ., St. Bernard, with the sharpness of his wit and zeal, has
stigmatised the vices of the rebellious people.’' He then suhjoins this character of the

and arrogance of the Romans? A nation nursed in sedition, crueL untractable, and scorning
to obey, unless they are too feeble to resist. then they promise to serve, they aspire to reign ;
if they swear allegiance, they watch the opportunity of revolt; yet they vent their discontent
in loud clamours, if your dom-S, or your counsels, are shut against them. Dexterous in mis-
chief, they have never learnt the science of doing good. Odious to earth and heaven, impious
to God, seditious among themselves, jealous of their neighbours, inhumati to strangers‚ they
love no one, by no one are they beloved 3 and while they wish to inspire fear, they live in base
and continual apprehension. They will not submit; they know not how to goverm faithless
to their superiors, intolerable to their equals, ungrateful to their benefactors, and alike impu-
