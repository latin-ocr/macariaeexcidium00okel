Balderock complained heavily, that the Thing should be made publick, to the great Hinderance
of the Numbers of Men he designed to bring off, and almost to the Hazard of his own Life;
for this Treaty was first in the Dublz'n Intelligence, and then in the London Gazette, dated
August lssllz.y which was before the Thing was really compleated : but those that have seen
Balclerock, will believe that it was partly his own Fault.”

The brother of O'Donnell's Secretary and Adjutant-General‚ Mr. Richards, under the
pretext of seeing whom, he is stated to have gone to Ginkell's camp, seems to have been the
officer, variously styled Captain and Colonel Richards, in the under-cited authorities on the
subject. As Captain RichardS, he is mentioned by Dr. Chai-les O’Conor to have been the.
writer of two valuable Journals connected with this war; the second of which is described,
as entitled, ‘⁵ Journall after my Negocz‘ations with O'Donnell.¹’

The Williamite officer of the name of Richards, mentioned by the London Gazette in con-
nexion with the sieges of Londonderry and Carrickfergus, as a Cuptain and Engineer, and de-
scribed in the Gazette, at the latter of those siegeS, as wounded in the thigh and shoulder‚ is
called Colonel Richards by Story, when likewise stating the fact of Richards* having been
wounded at the same siege, in the trenches, on the night of Thursday, August find, 1689.
Did these different modes of designating Richards arise from the circumstance of his having
been in the engineer service? for there CERTAINLY was no Colonel Richards of any infantry,
lzorse, or (lv-agona regiment, in the armies of Marshal Schonberg, William 111„ or Lieutenant-
General Ginkell, in Ireland, during the years 1689, 1690, or 1691 ².

The following abstract of O'Donnell‘s conduct,—in carrying on a treaty with General
Ginkell, to join the Williamite Government‚-in getting money, on that score, from Colonel
Michelburne, the Commander of their Forces besieging Sligo,-in then compelling Mic-hel-
burne to raise the siege‚-—and, finally, injoining him with the reinforcements from Dublin,
which obliged the Irish Governor of Sligo, Sir Teague ORegan, to surrender,-is given from
the contemporary Williamite pamphlet on that affair.
