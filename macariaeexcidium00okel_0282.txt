stone, and expired in a few days. The latter was severely wounded in the persons of 1115 ser-
vants. In a civil commotion, several of 1115 priests had been made prisoner33 and the inhuman
Romans, reserving one as a guide for his brethren, put out their eyes, crowned them with
ludici-cus mitreS, mounted them on asses with their faces to the mil, and extorted an oath,
that, in this wretched condition, they should offer themselves as a lesson to the head of the
‹jhm-chJ‘ Respecting such scenes, the histor-ian adds: ‘· Hope or fear, lassitude or remorse,
the characters of the men, and the circumstances of the times, might sometimes obtain an in-
terval of peace and obedience3 and the Pope was restored with joyful acclamations to the
Lateran or Vatican, from whence he had been driven with threats and violence. But the
root of mischief was deep and perennial; and a momentary calu] was preceded and followed
hy such tempests, as had almost sunk the bark of St. Peter.'’

In the 531110 century, in which Rome was the seat of suc-h outrages as these, the general
condition of the Irish, moral as well as politic-al, was so low, that with reference to the man-
ner in which St. Bernard speaks of the state of Ireland, in his life of her celebrated Primate,
St. Malachy O'Morgair, Mr. O'Conor has observed: “ It is no wonder if the holy Abbot
should denominate such a people a nation of barbariam. They were, in 3 great degree, what
he represents them.'· On this head, Dr. Lanigan states: ‘⁶ We find terrible oppressions and
cruelties perpetrated in said times by Irish kings or dynasts, who did not scruple to plunder,
devastate, and burn churches and religious places. For instance, the church of Ardbraccan
was, together with a number of people therein, burned and pillaged in 1109 by the Hy-Briuns‚
who destroyed also the adjacent village. The Dalcassians of Thomond plundered and laid
waste the monastery of Clonmacnois in l 111, at, it 15 said, the instigation of Murtogh
O'Brian; and they, or some other party of Monwnians, pillaged it again in 1115. Aedh
O'Rourke and the Hy-Briuns killed Maelbrigid, abbot of Reus, and many others, on the
last Sunday of summer in 1117. We have seen above, that Turlogh O'Conor burned Cashel
and Lismore in 1121, and that Emly was plundered in 1123. Conor O’Lochlin, an Ulster
prince. having marched with a great army into Meath, amidst other depredations, burned in
1127 the steeple of the church of Trim, in which a very considerable number of people was
shut up at the time. Thus, it appears, that several of the Irish princes and chieftains had
imbibed the spirit of the Danes, spe-ring neither churches, nor monasteries, nor ecclesiastics,
according as suited their views3 a system, which was held in abhorrence by their ancestors,
and which often excited them to unite, in defence os their altars, against the Scandinaviau
robbers. This was one of the sad effects of the contests between various powerful families
aspiring to the sovereignty of all Ireland, and again between divers members of said families
quarrelling among themselves for precedency. In these contests, the respective parties and
their adherents stopped at nothing, while endeavouring to establish their claims, and harassed
and persecuted without distinction all those, whom they looked upon as their opponents.” Again,
under the year 1 134, “ 1 find it stated‚'’ adds the Doctor, ‘⁵ that, in the same year, the cathe-
1113] of Tuam was stormed and forcibly entered by the Dalcassians, and that Derry, the

churches of Rath-luirg (1131111010), Raphoe, and Clenard, part of Cong and Eithne‚ Roscom-
