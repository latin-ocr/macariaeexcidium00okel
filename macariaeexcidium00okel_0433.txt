and the garrisons which destroyed everything that could serve for sustenance, were soon re-
duced to the necessity either of perishing by famine, as vast multitudes dish, or of making
their sub1nission.”

The Irish historian, Don Philip O‘Sullivan Beare, after laying down, that, in the long war
of his countrymen against Elizabeth‚ ¹¹ Non armis, sed artibus varijs, Ibernos fuisse superat05‚''
thus :illudes to this brass money, and the other policy by which it's impos-ilion upon Ireland
was accompanied: ⁴¹ Nec est praetereundum aliud Protestantium stratagemma, qui Catho-
licorum agros, municipia, segetes, armenta, ferro, flammaque corrumpebant, vt quos virtute
superare no poterant, fame, δι inedia vincerent, neque suorum quidem Prouincialium, vel
Ibernorum factionis Anglicae finibus interdum parcentes, frumentum ἃ armentum interuer-
tendo, & agriculturam prohibendo, ne commeatus esset, quo Catholici potiti bellum gererent.
Aliena moneta Reginae iussu excusa mittitur in Iberniam anno 1601. qua partim Regina
facultatibus consumptis exercitum alebat, partim Ibernicum aurum δι argentum est surrep-
tum. Quae simul ac bellum est confectum, nihil valere cgpit magna iactura lhernori'i, eti-:2
tributariorum Reginae, maxime mercatorum. Quippe persuasum habuerunt Protestantes
nunqua] finiendum fuisse lbernicum bellum, dum lbernis commeatus suppeteret, vel aurum, ἅ*
argentum, quo illum compararent: exercitui vero suo Angliam victum suppeditatur-am. Hze
causzg fuerunt, quamobrem tanta vis Ibernorum pauperum exteras gentes, maxime Hispaniam,
8: Galliam inundauerit.” And, in another place, iuquiring “Quemadmodum Catholici sint
viribus diminuti‚’' after mentioning the various contrivances, by which ⁴⁶ Angli, in summum
discrimen amittendae lberniue deducti,'’ resolved to prevent this, O'Sullivan adds z ‘⁶ Principio
aenea moneta excusa in lberniam mittitur, qua omne Ibernum aurum, & argeutum in Angliam
subtrahitur, ipsaque breui Cepit nullius esse pretij. Quo effectum est vt Iberui pecunia sua de-
fraudati sint ad ingentem paupertatem redacti. segetes quoque scInduntur, δε alia damna
inferuntur.”

Moryson, as cited by Simon, speaks of the above-mentioned money for Ireland as ‘⁴ this
bitter pill, which impoverished not only the rebels, hut her Majesty's best servants in this
kingdom, only enriching her paymasters sitting quietly at home„ while others adventured
daily their blood in the service.” Simon computes, that ‘¹ if at that time (1601) the merchant
had complied, and parted with his sterling money ; if he had brought it to the office, there to
receive twenty-one shillings of the base money (in reality not worth above three shillings and
four-peuce) for every twenty shilIIngs of sterling money, his εἰσι-ἦ, iftwelve thousand pounds,
must at once have been reduced to three thousand poumls, noy, to two thousand pomuls, sor the
goldsmiths did not value these shillings at more than two penee each.”

Elizabeth's successor, King James 1., in his Proclamation of November thh, 1604, boasts
of having restored to the ⁴⁸ realme of Ireland monies of pure silver, in lieu of the base coyne,

with which the necessity of the tymes, by aceidend of wat-res, constrayned our sister, the late

Queen of happy memory, to pay the armies.'' NOTE 190,
