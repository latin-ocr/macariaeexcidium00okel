much eredit at last, as to make the King ballance with himself, whether partie he should en-
deavour to satisfy; but My Lord Tyrconnel being actually return'd‚ be thought it not proper
to recall him, nor to alter measures already settled with the Court of France, least that chief
Minister [Louvois] might turn such instability in Councells to the King's further prejudice‚
against whom he was but too much bent already. The King therefore resolved to support his
own authority in My Lord Tyrconnel, and let things goe on in the methods already agreed
upon. and hoped to send back the Army Ambassadors in such a temper, as would make them
live easily with him ; which eost the King a great deal of trouble and paim, and was lost labour
in the end. But it was the King’s hard fate not only to suffer by his Rebellious Subjects, but
to be ill serued by his Allies, and tormented by divisions amongst his own people 3 as if his
vnemies gaue him not disquiet enough, but that his friends must also come into their aid, to
exercise his patience, and agrevate his sufferings by turns''¹³.

by King James‘s forces, the Williamite Chaplain, in describing the return os those emigrants
to the North, in October, 1691, after the conclusion of the war by the Treaty of Limerick,
says: ‘⁴ All the Roads and other Places leading from the Counties of Kerry and Clare
towards the North, are now full of Nothing but Creights, and vast Stocks of Cattle driving
homewards‚'’ &a

Yet, of the crowding ofso many of the inhabitants of the other parts of the island into that
occupied by King James's army during the winter of 1690-91, the same writer acquaints us
with this pleasant and characteristic result: “ It's observable‚ that there have not been so
many Marriages for many Years before amongst the Iria-h, as was last Winter in Limerzhk,
Galway, and all C'onnazcght over ; whether it was out of Confidence that they should certainly
