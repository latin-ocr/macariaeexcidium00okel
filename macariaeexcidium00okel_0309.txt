The manifesto gives this account of the principles, which, it affirms,that the “settlers‚'' both
lay and clericaL maintained, as to the existence osa right, on their part, to exercisc a constant
system of destruction and spoliation upon the native Irish; and (at this period, of about ⁴200
years previous to the Reformati0n,) the same document classes the professors of such principles
with lzeretics.

“Dogmatizent enim luvretiee non solum illorum laici δε seculares,'’ observes this docu-
ment, “sed eciam quidam religiosi ipsorum, quod non magis est peccatum interficere homi-
nem Hiberniamm, quam unum canem, aut quodlibet aliud animal brutum. Et, in hujusmodi
opposicionis hrcreticoe assercionem, quidam illorum monachi affirmant intrepide, quod si contin-
geret ipsos, sicut saepe contingit, quod hominem Hiberniacum interficerent, ob hoc non desis-
terent a celebracione¹¹ eciam uno die. Et sicut indubitanter monachi Cistersiensis ordinis de
Granardo Ardmacanensis diocesis necnon S: monachi de insula ejusdem ordinis Dunensis

Κ This doctrine, as to the original Irish, in genc-
ral, having No claim at all to Ireland, mags have been
deduced, by the Anglo-Norman and their subordi-
natc saxon or English settlers, from the double
circumstance ofthe sovereignty over Ireland having
boen transferred to their King Heni-y, and his snc-
cessors, by the Popes, or Heads oi the Church, and
from the manner in which Henry himself acted
upon this sovereignty, hy the grants which he made
to his principal Anglo-Norman followers in Ire-
land-in equal contempt of his engngcinents with
the Irish Princes who submitted to him, and disre-
gard of any title of the original inhabitants of Irc-
land to their own country. Respecting those grants
of Henry, Sir John Davies‚ after specifying the
t'ew Anglo-Norman chiefs, among whom they were
made, says: “Thus was ΛΠ, Ῑνεῖαιιιί cantonized
among tenne Persons of the English Nation; and
thogh they had not gained the Possession of one
third Part of the whole Kingdom, yet in Title they
were Oumers and Lords osall, so as Nothiny was

left to bee 9ruunted to the Natives !'' The Anglo-
Nox-man patentees, or English adventui-ers under
them. hence assuming that tlzey had acquiret] a right
to the whole island, and the old Irish naturally
acknowledging 110 such right at their expense, tho
sword should necessarily decide the matter between
them, as it accordingly did, for several successive
centuries. The question of the ownership ot'the
land of England was much sooner settled there by
its Norman or other French conquerors, thnn that
of the land of Ireland was by its Anglo-Norman or
English invaders-(Sir John Davies's Discuvwie,
