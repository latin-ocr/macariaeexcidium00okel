concepimus, quanto per ejusdem Regis potentiam in terra vestra, cooperante Domino, major
pax erit atque tranquilitas; et gens Hybernica, quae per enormitatem et spurcitiam vitiorum
adeo videbatur longius recesisse, divino cultu propensius informabitur, et melius Christiana¹

fidei suscipiet disciplinam.

Unde super eo, quod tam potenti et magnifico Regi, et tam devoto ecclesiae filio, vos vo-
luntate liber'a subdidistis, providentiam vestram digna laudis commendatione prosequimur,
cum exinde vobis, ecolesiae, et toti populo illius terrae, utilitas speretur non immodica proven-
tui-:13 monemus itaque nobilitatem vestram attentius et mandamus, quatinus fidelitatem quam
tanto Regi sub juramenti religione fecistis, ei cum debita subjectione firmam et inconcussam

That those privileges were not preserved has been
sufficiently shown from Cambrensis. That they
were not enlaryed appears to be equally evident
from the Irish manifesto of Donald O’Neill, Sec,
to Pope John XXII. in the reign of Edward II. In
this document, aster mentioning the number of
Christian Kings, who, ‘⁸ without any mixture of fo—
reign hlood.'' ruled in 1re1and, till the time of chry
11.‚ the Irish observe: “ And those Kings were
not Englishmen, nor of any other nation but our
own, who, with pious liberality, bestowed ample
endowments in lands, and many immunities, on the
Irish Church, though in modern times our churches
are most damnahly plundered by the Anglicans, hy
whom they are almost entirely despoiled.'' And,
amongst their other reasons sor their taking up
arms under Edward de Bruce, the Irish assert, that
they do so, to ‘⁵ restore to the Church those pro-
pertieS, ot' which it has been so damnably aud in-
humauly despoiled.‘' Again, concerning the cou-
duct of the Anglo-Normans, with regard to the
lands of the Isish Chureh, it is said: ‘⁶ As to the
Church lands, so far from extending them, they
have confined them, retrenehed them, invaded them
on all sides; so that some cathedral churches have
been, by open force, notoriously plundered of half
their possessions.’' Hence. too, with reference to
some ecclesiastical occur-rences in the following
reign, or the nineteeuth year of Edward ΙΙΙ., we
find Mr. Moore remarkiug: ‘⁶ Even at that period,
when all were of one faith, the Chureh of the 9⁰-
ve'rnment‚”-0r, in other words, ofthe Anglo-Nor-
man settlers‚-.“ and the Church of the people, in
Ireland, were almost as much separated from each

other by difference in race, language, political feel⁴
ing, and even ecclesiastica] discipline, as they have
been, at any period since, by ilitt'erence in creeds.
The attempt made by the Synod of Cashel„ in tho
year1172, to assimilate the Irish Church, in its
rites and discipline, to that of England, entirely
failed of its object: aud the native clergy :md pcn-

rules, as is the decre-es of that n‘iemoruble Synod
had never been issued. Disllenrteniug,” hc adds,
“as may be some of the couclusious too plainly de-
ducible from this fact, it clearly shows, ut least,
that the establishment of the reformes] Clmrch, in
that kingdom, was not the first or sole cause of the
hitter hostility between the two races.’' Nor are
we without traces of the differcncc herc allmled
to in ecclesiastical matters down to the reign os
Henry VIII„ in which the great religious revo-
lution, called the Reformatiom commenced in these
islands. Under the year 1521, says Cox, ⁶· Car-
dinal ll'nlsey, who was Legate [Ie latere in Euyland,
sent over Bulls and Dispensations into Irelaml, by
his Factor and Register, John Allan ; but it seems
they did not turn to account, for Alleu, iu his Lettcr
to the Cardinal, complains, they went off but
slowly, because the Irish had so little sense of Re-
h'gion‚ that they married within the Levitical De-
yrees, without Dispensations, and also because they
questionedhis Grace's Autlmrz'ty in Irelaml esra-3-

narrow limits to which any English ecelesiastica}
authority or discipline would be confined in those
times, when not acknowledged beyond the Pale,
