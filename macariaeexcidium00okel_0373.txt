with which James proceedsfrom Dnblin, June thh, 1690, to meet him.

King James's Memoirs, in mentioning the great disadvantages under which the King lay,
in attempting to defend himselfagainst William in 1690, speak of his army as “a body ofmen
in great measure newly raised, half disciphned, half armed, and not above halfthe number of
the Enemie, with a weak artillery, and very little mony.'’ The royal Memoirs further state,
in reference to the numerical inferiority of the King's force compared with William's, that
“ he had not abone twenty thousand men, and the other between forty and fifty thousand.'‘
In giving an account of the {iring of the artillery the day before the action of the Boyne, the
same work mentions Willian1·s artillery as “ very numerous, being ιιι Ieme fifty pieces (as was
sayd) with severall small mortars which they fired also‚'’—this last circumstance, by the way,
being apparently alluded to, in the old Williamite ballad upon the engagement:

‘⁵ ΚίηῌΠ James, he pitch'd his tents between
His lines. sor to retire ς
King William threw his bamb-sltells in,
And set them all on tire !''

The ane of Berwick, who was at the Rome, affirms respecting what he designates the
“grande disproportion‘' between his father's and William's army: “ Les ennemis avoient

quarante-cinq mille hommes, 81 nous n'GtIOns que vingt-trois mille.u
Fere d'Orleans, the Jesuit, who may be cited as a Jacobite authority, since, In the intro-

duction to the third volume of his work on the Revolutions of England, he tells us he enjoyed
the liberty of consulting King James ιιιί libitum, and also obtained information from Mr. She-
ridan, who was high in office under that Monarch's government in lreland, says, respecting
the numbers and artillery of the Williamite army, that William ‘⁴ s'etantjoint aveo le ahu-‹³-
chal de Schomberg, marcha avec quarante-cinq mille hommes, & soixante piet-es de gros canonv
vers Duhlin pour chere-her le Roi.'' The same Freuch writer adds of King James's force,
though joined by Lauzun's Freneh, that “l'armee du Roi de la Grande Bretagne ne put
gueres passer vingt mille hommes, une grande partie a demi armez, St n'ayant d'artillerie
que douze pieces ‹le campagne, qu'on avoit ameni-es de Franee.”

Thus, according to the Jacobite accounts, James's army would be from 20,000 to ‘ZSMUO
