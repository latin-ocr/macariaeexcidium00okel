long retarded by contrary Winds‚ that the Winter was fai-r advaneed
before they arrived in Syria, in the seaport Town of Malus, when
Coridon, at the sanie Time, was ready to sett Sail from an other Port, in
his Returne to Cyprus. But they were not many Furlongs at Sea, when
a Courier arrived from Syria, bringing to ijridates the above-mentioned
Order ofAmasis, proeured by Coridon, that noe sneh Persons should be
suffered to goe out of Cyprus. In the King's Letter, come by the same
Courier⁷ he deelared that his Subjeets of Cyprus could not give greater
Proofs of their Fidelity to him, than by their ready Submission and Obe-
dience to Coriclon, and by their free and exact Observances of his Orders.
Nothing more unwelcome than this Declaration could come from Amasis

legatis ex Insula navigandi potestas fieret. Litteris regiis unii allatis conti-

ejusque mandata libenter ac voluntarie exequerentur. Nihil minusjucundum
Cypriis Delphicae religionis cultoribus accidere poterat, quam haec tanta Amasis
erga Coi-itionem fiducia atque inelinatio; nemo enirn ambigebat eum omni nisu
