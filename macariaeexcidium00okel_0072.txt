the Head of a gallant Army, advanced towards him, and pitched his
roy-all Camp within 60 Furlongs to that of Nisias, who made a defen-

the Ciliciam Camp, especially about the latter End of the Campaigne,
When it was slenderly manned, lost a sair Opportunity to putt an End
to the lVarr of Cyprus, and perhaps to that of Cilicia, where the Ama-
sizms, if iVisz'as were defeated in Cyprus, would be encouraged to sall

comitted by the Captains of Amasis, to give [Visius the Honour of dis-
