mon, Rossmor, and several other principa} churehes, were burned and plundered by the
Momonians, headed by their king, Conor O‘Brian. These devastations must have been a
part of those committed by the great army, composed of Irish and Danes, which he and other
princes led in that year against Leth-cuinn, or the northern half of Ireland. In the follow-
ing year Cumea-mor Maconmara (Macnamara), King of lbh-Caisin, (in Thomond,) the chief
plunderer of the cathedral of Tuam, was killed by the Demnonians, under Cormac Mac—Carthy,
who ravaged Thomond. Other instances of this disgraceful mode of wat-fare and want of
respect for churches occur in those times. Thus Kildare was plundered by Dermod O'Brian
and others in 1136 ; and, in the same year, Clonard was pillaged and destroyed by the people
of Breffny and Fermanagh. Even Cormae Mac-Carthy is said to have burned a place called
lllaighe Deiscirt, both houses and churches.''

With the desire to refute the disadvantageous representation given by Adrian IV. of the
general state of religion and morals in Ireland, for some time previous to the Anglo-Norman
invasi0n‚—a state, alleged to have been so bad by the Pope, as to make him not ashamed to
avow, that even the conquest of the country by a foreign power, on condition ofsuppressing such
evils, ought to be authorized by a Papal bull‚—with the desire to refute such a ‹liscreditable
picture of the religious and moral condition of the Irish people in those dayS‚ Doctor Reating
says1z-“ I wonder here at the condition in the bull of Adrianus 1V.‚ by which he bestowed
Erin on the second Henry. This was the condition, according to the Chronicle of Stowe,
viz„ Henry was bound to restore the Catholic religion, which was fallen in Erin; but it is
not likely that the Pope would have inserted this condition in the bull, if he had not been
satisfied, that the religion had fallen into decay. But whoever palmed this upon the pope,
they told him a lie3 for it is clear that. until this time, no decay came upon the religion,
which Patrick brought into Erin3 and there are many trust-worthy foreign writers, who
bear witness to this, from time to time ; for although, according to Beda in the history of
Samon-land, there was a dispute between the clergy of Erin and the clergy of Saxon-land
concerning the celebration of Easter, and that some of the clergy of Erin were tainted with
the Pelagian heresy. still the greater part of the Gaels were pure from both. And with res-
pect to the religion, from the time os Brian to the period of the invasion of the Galls‚ it is
clear, that it flourished throughout Erin 3 and, therefore, that it was not true for the people
who palmed upon the Pope, that the religion was down in Erin, when the island was bestowed

upon Henry by the Pope.

3 The passage of Keating herc given is translated
by Mr. O’Donovan from a copy of the honest
Doctor’s work in MS„ which Mr. O'Donovan
considers as aniongst the oldest and best copies ex-
tant. To avoid what the writer of this note would
consider an unwarrantable interference with the an-
tique air and peculiar local colouring of Keating’s
style. the old proper names used by him have been
as much as possible retained, instead of being. after

“ In
the usual mode of translation, entirely modernized.
Thus ‘⁴ Erin, Sason-land, Gaels and Galls‚⁷' have
been retained, instead of our modern equivalents
for them, or ‘⁴ Ireland, England, Irish, English.''
Of the word “ GaIIs‚'' it may be observed‚ that it
is, as opposed to ‘⁶ Gaels,'' the general name of the
old natives for any foreiyners, or stravtyers‚ the
Danes, for instance, as well as the English. See
Note 56.
