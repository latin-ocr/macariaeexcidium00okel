had reduced a great part of the island to a desert), that the Roman Catholic inhabitants of the
country could not have been more than l,‘.)00‚000 at the utmost; while the Protestant portion of
the population, who might amount to about 200,000, were upon William’s sideq. The national
revenue also of Ireland, which, according to the information furnished by Archbishop King
in his appendix, averaged, at its best period before the war, or from 1682 to 1685, only about
1:266209 a year, dwindled, during the struggle, into a brass currency, and, from that, com-
paratively to nothing. The great deficiency of military necessaries iu Ireland when hostilities
commenced, and the very inadequate supplies sent to King James's adherents by the French
Minister, from 1689 to 1691, notwithstanding the pressing wants os the Jacobstes, and the
abundant resourees ostheir enemies in those points, have likewise been shown. Yet, how
much greater was the force the Irish Jacobites obliged William to employ in Ireland, than he
had on foot elsewhere, (even against the Grand Illonarque on the Continenti) may be partly
estimated by the following data, extraeted from a military document of the 27th of January‚
1692 in the State Paper Office, London3 layiug down, under the intention ofa reduction in
William's forces, which, however, was found impracticable as regards 1reland, what would be
the number of soldiers requisite for tlmt country, and all other quarters, at home and abroad,
where troops were judged necessary to be stationed, by the King's government.

From the ‘⁸ Abstract of the Numbers of the Forces'' of william ΙΙΙ. in this paper, setting
forth the respective complements ofsulcliers, with the names os Regiments, δια, for Englzmd,
Scotland, Flanders, the West indies, and Ireland, we find, that the proportion for England is
specified as 11‚343 men; for Scodand, 5878 men; for Flanders, against Louis XH'Js army
there, 11‚144 men,- for the West Indies. 960 men 3 for Ireland, 35:289 men! Thereffire, out
of a total of 64,614 Williamite soldier-5, it was calculated that, while but 29325 were to be
stationed in England, scotland, Flanders, and the West Indies altogether, [relaml alone should
have 3:3‚289 1111311Ῐ ! And opposite this large amount, in the original document, the following
memorandum is added: ⁴¹ For which 4000 recruits of foot at least will be necessary, besides
those to be made in Ireland l''—that is, among the Protestants there. But, as has been inti-
mated‚ this amount of 35:289 soldiers for Ireland was found to be insufficient. For the number
of privates, belonging to the Infantry‚ Horse, and Dragoon Regiments of William III.'s Army
for Ireland in 1691, are in the list, marked MCXXXVIH„ amongst the papers of his Irish

(Ι Mr. Macaulay calculates the Roman Catholic
or Jacobite population of Ireland, in those days, at

(which, however, seems too low an estimate‚) and
the Protestant colonists‚ 01·Williamites, he rates as
above, or at ‘⁶ about two hundred thousand.'' Story
makes a very strong allusion to the smallness of the
population of Ireland at this period, in excusinghis
master, William HL, for not having accomplished
more than he did, during the campaign of 1690.

all the World besides.'’—-(Macaulay's History of
