lesquels se trouverent dans cette rencontre, se battirent parfaitement bien, et ayant vu que
leur Chef etoit messe, ils ne voulureut point abandonner leurs ennemis, qu'ils n'eussent pris
18 Comte de Sales, qui les commandoit. Ils le menerent en triomphe au Lord Moncassel,
pour le consoler de la blessure qu‘il avoit recu'e.” Lord MountcasheL besides, was not in
ltaly at the battle of Marsaille in 1693, but serving as Lieutenant-General in Germany, under
the Marshal de Lorges; and, among the 215 names of Allied Officers taken at that battle, by
the Freneh, the name of De Sales (or De Salles) is not to be found; so that it could only
have been after the defeat in 1690, that the nobleman of that name mentioned the circum-
stance at table to Lord Mountcashel‚ in the presence of the Captain‚ who eommunicated the
matter to his countryman, the Abbe.

With respect to the ancient supremaey of the Irish in the Ι518 of Man, Mr. Moore, in
mentioning the defeat of the Ultonians‚ by the famous Irish Monarch, Cormac Ulfadha, in
the third century, and the consequent banishment of numbers of them into that island, says:
‘¹ That the island of Eubonia, as Man was then called, belonged in early times to lreland,
appears from Ptolem, by whom it is marked as a dependency ofthat country; and, in a work
attributed to the cosmographer, AEthicus, xre are told, ‘ The 1518 of Man, as well as Hibernia,
is inhabited by the tribes of the Scots‚'—‘ Menavia insula aeque ae Hibernia a Scotorum gen-
tibus habitatur: In the time of St. Pamin-iz, it was still an Irish island, and the favourite
resort of such holy persons, as wished to devote themselves to a life of seclusion and prayer.'’

As to the balance of invasion between Ireland and England‚ the same historian considers,
that, until Henry II.'s reign, the Irish were the aggressors. “ Up to this period‚'‘ he ob-
serves, “ the tide of invasion appears to have been entirely from the Irish side of the channel' ;
and in all the struggles of VVales against English domination, troops were wafted over to her
aid, in the corachs of her warlike neighbours. In the rebellion of Godwin and his sons
against Edward the Confessor, Ireland furnished, as we have seen, men and ships in their
cause 3 and, after the defeat at Hastings, three sons of the conquered King (Harold) sought
refuge and succour in the same country, and were enabled to fit out from thence a large fleet,

for the invasion of England''⁹'.

' This assertion of Mr. Moore should, nevorthe-
less, be regarded rather as yenerally than univer-
sully true. In the seventh and eighth centuries espe-
cially, see the several instauces of invasion that old
Charles O'Conor refers to as made from Britain,
which he speaks of, in connexion with Congal Claon
and the battle of Moyrath, as then ⁴* the common
asylum of the domestic mal-eontents'’ of Ireland.—
