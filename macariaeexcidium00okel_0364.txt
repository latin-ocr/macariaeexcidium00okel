Marshal Schonberg. for military supplies, it 15 mentioned by Story respecting Chai-lemont,

place. ‘¹ May the esl‘· (1690), says the Williamite Chaplain, ‘¹ Lieutenant Colonel sslacmellon,
with about 400 Men, Ammuniffion, and some small Quantities of Provisions, got into (3713νί9-

And the second Week in sslay, several Englixh, a Brandenburg, and Three Dutch Regiments

so that we had now an Excellent Army, all over-joyed with the Assurance that His Majesty
in Person (William 111.) designed to make that Campaign in Irelaml. A Part of our Army
also began to take the Field, and Enoainp almost round Clzarlemout; Cannon and Mortars
were sent up that way too to force old Teagzce ORegan, the Governour, from his Nest, if
he would not quit it otherways; but their Provisions being spent, and no Hopes of Relief
appearing, 011 the 12111 of May 1119 Governour desired a Parley, and after some Time it was
agreed, That this Gari-ison should march out with their Arms and Baggage, which they did

Babingtou's Regiment taking Possession of the Plaee. We found 17 Ρ19995 of Cannon, l large

Of the distress to which the 111511 garrison were reduced for provisions before 1119 place
was given up, Story elsewhere notes: “They had left no Provisions in the Castle, but a little
dirty Meal and Part osa Quarter ofmusty Beef: And certainly they were reduced to great
Necessity, for as they marched along, several of them were chawing and feeding very heartily
upon Pieces of dried Hides, with Hair and all 00.” Η9 then mentions, how, after the Irish
had left the Castle, he found there a document, amongst others, which it were to be wished
he had preserved in an appendix. ‘⁴ 111 Teague's own Romus* says he, ‘⁸ I saw several Papers;
amongst the rest a Copy of 3 Letter to some about K. James, giving an Account of the State

inhabited formerly. The Town of Charlemont stood by the Castle, 35 we were told, but the
Irislz had so levelled it, that Nothing remained to show, that ever there had been any such
Thing.'' For his defence of Charlemont, the veteran Governor was knighted‚ as Harris
informs 05, by King James. ‘¹ The Duke,” adds the Williamite Chaplain, respecting Marshal

Schonberg,
