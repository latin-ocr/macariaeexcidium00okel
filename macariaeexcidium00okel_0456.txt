what men were thought capable of, they threw down the planks and beams notwithstanding
the continual fire of the Enemy, and held it out till they had finished their worke, tho most of
them were killed in the action. This forced the Enemie to try an other method, and en-
deavour to carry on their work, by a close gallerie upon the bridg. but the Irish found means
to set it on fire, which so disheartned the English, that they held a council of war whether
they should not rais the Siege 3 and had they not, by great fortune just at that time, found a
fordable place on the river, they had certainly (lone it.¹'

The Williamite Chaplain, in his narrative of the siege, has this passage illustrative of the
bravery shown by the Irish soldiery: “ The 26th. was spent in firing from seven Batteries
upon the Enemies Works, and a great many were kill'd in endeavouring to repair them. About
thirty VVaggons loaden with Powder come to the Camp ; and that Night we possess our selves
ot' all the Brfflge, except one Arch at the farther End on Cmmaught Side, which was broken
down, and we repair another broken Arch in our Possessi0n3 and all Night our Guns and
Mortars play most furiously. . . . The General and the other Great Officers resolve to try what
can be done in forcing our Way through Allzlone it self, and therefore we labour hard to gain
the Bridge ; but what we got here was lnoh by Ineh as it were, the Enemy sticking very close
to it, though great Numbers of them were slain by our Guns : And this Serviee eost us great
Store of Ammunition.''

Colonel Felix O'Neilh aster observing of the English, in his letter to the Countess of
Antrim, how “ they raised their batteries and trenches so very high, that a cat could scarce
appear without being knocked in the head by great or small shot, and all these disadvan-
tages‚'¹ alleges, of the oourage of the Irish soldiers ε “ and notwithstanding the French Ge-
nerals aoknowledged, they never saw more resolution and firmuess, in any men of any nati0n3
nay, blamed the men for their forwardness, and cried them up for brave fellows, as intrepid as

Captain Parker represents the Williamite army to have been generally of the same unfa-
vourable opinion, regarding Ginkell's attempt to eross the Shannon at Atblone, as Colonel
O'Kelly affirms that St. Ruth and the other French Geuerals were, and as the Duke of Ber-
wick, by the extract from his Memoirs, given in Note 213, appears to have been, Having
premised, respecting the “ difficulties'' in the way of such an attempt-“ Notwithstanding all
these difficulties, our Generals seemed resolved on passing the river at this place, for they
judged, from the extreme dryness of the season, that it might probably be fordable‚'' the Wil-
