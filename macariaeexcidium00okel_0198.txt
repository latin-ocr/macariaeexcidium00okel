his State Papers, and designated, ‘⁶ A Journal of the most remarkable Occurrences that hap-
pened between His Majesty's Army and the Forces under the Command of Mareschal de
Schomberg, in Ireland, from the 12th of August to the 23rd os October, 1689. Faithfully
collected by James Nihell, Esq.‚ Under Secretary to the Right Honourable the Earl of Mel-
fort‚ His Majesty's prime Secretary of State.” Jatnes likewise issued at least one pamphlet
upon the war in Ireland. Of this exceedingly rare production, the writer of these lines was
so fortunate as to meet with a copy, and to be allowed to transcribe it. lt is entitlecL ‘⁶ A
Relation of what most remarkably happened during the last Campaign in Ireland, betwixt
His Majesty's Army Royal, and the Forces of the Prince of Orange, sent to joyn the Rebels
under the Count de Sehomberg. Published by Authority. Dublin: printed by Alderman
James Malone, Bookseller in Skinner Row, 1689.·’ There were also remaining in Ireland,
even so late as the period of those sectarian disturbances in Ulster‚ about two years pre-
vious to the insurrection of 1798, still more rare and valuable, or unpublished‚ documents for
a Histoi-y of the War of the Revolution.

The most important, as it would appear, of those collections, was in the possession of the
Rev. James Coigly‚ of the County Armagh, executed in the year last mentioned, for high
treason, at Maidstone‚ in Kent. In the sketch of his life by himself, dated ‘⁶ Maidstone Goal,
30th April, 179SJ‘ the reverend gentleman, who, from what he states, may have obtained the
papers alluded to through some of his ancestors connected with the cause of King James ΙΙ. in
Ireland, in describing the wreclzing and plunder of his father's house, by a ‘⁵ mob calling thern-
selves Orzmgemen,'' ertes thus : ‘⁴ With more than Gothic rage, they totally destroyed a choice
collection of books, my property, in the Irish, English, Freneh, Italian, Latin, and Greek
languages; together with materials to compose a History of the last lVar in lreland, being
papers never publiskoed, and in the hand-writing of the late King James; Tyrconnell, then

So much for the destruction of such a valuable mass of Jacobite materials for oompiling a
detailed narrative of the W'ar of the Revolution in Ireland; and there were others existing
here in Colonel O'Kelly's time, that might be mentioned, if necessary. But it will suffice to

have specified the foregoing documentss.
