In the latter end of the reign of Henry V111., observes Cox, “ the Necessities of the
State obliged the King to Coyn Brass or mixt Moneys‚ and to make it currant in Irelmzd
by Proclamation to the great Dissatissaction of all the People‚ especially the Soldier5.” ln
Harris‘s ware, the Proclamation to that effect is spoken of, as one ‘⁴ prohibiting the Im-
portation of this Money into Englrmd, under the Penalty of forfeiting Treble the Value‚
and of Fine and lmprisonment.” Under Henry's successor, Edward VI., this sort of base
coin continued to circulate in IrelamL since we read, in Cox, of the King being “ advised to

Again, in Elizabeth's reign, or the year 1601, an exc-lusively base coin was fabricated for
lreland, respecting which the English historian Carte says: ‘⁶ The regular payment of her
army in Ireltmd, in gold and silver coin, had drawn thither a large quantity of the specie of
Engltmd: and, a great part ofit coming, either by excursions, plunder‚ or traffick, into the
hands of the rebels, they were enabled to purchase in France, Flanders, and Ilollamle. what-

nation, or valuation, that is shilling for shiuing. and

sic de certeris, being tendered in payment of wages,
fees, stipends, or debts, that they should be punished
