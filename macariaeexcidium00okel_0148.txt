brought noe Money out of Syria. The well-affected Cypriam were not
ignorant of Coridon‘s Design by this Project, which could be noe other
but to make the Nation sensible, that great Antiochus, after soe many
assureances of Royall Succour, sent them now a Captain without Money,
which all Mankind knows to be the true Sinews of War. He further
expected, and he had no less than Reason, that it would altogether dis-
courage the F ori-eigners in Theodore's Army to desert to that of Amasis,
where noe Pay was to be had3 and those Ends which he proposed by
the boasted Levey being once obtained (for the Nation was now satis-
fyed, and the Enemy understood it well, that Plzyrrus brought noe
Money), he declined calling sor what he knew could not be had, and
accepted the 10,ooo Beaves, which the Country freely offered. But the
greatest Obstacle that could be given to Plzgsrrzcs, to goe on with his
Design, was the lVant of Boats to carry his Provisions uppon the River
of Lycas, from Paphos to Arsinoe, where the Army was to rendesvous.
These Boats should have been provided the VVinter and Spring before,
when Corislon was revelling away the Time, between Paphos and Cy-

plo deprehenderant C'oriclonz's artes, id unum agentis, ut ea demum natio per-
sentisceret magnum illum Antiochum post tot regii subsidii pollicitacioneS,
nudum tandem, atque inopem pecuniarum Ductorem misisse 3 cun] tamen
constanti mortalium omnium judicio nummi sint veri nervi roburque bello-
rum, absque quibus militares animi marcent et elanguescunt. Sperabat prae-
terea, nec immerito sane, exteros, qui sub Theodoro mercede conducti mere-
bant, et ad deficiendum inclinatiores habebantur, tardius jam ad ΑῃπιείαηιιὸἼ
partes, ubi nulla militum stipendia, transituros. Cum autem exitum, quem
in edicenda pecunia desideraverat, jam obtinuisset (nee enim Cyprii modo
ignorabant, sed et iuter hostes emanaverat Pyrrhum nulla pecunia onustum
advenisse) mutato veluti consilio, urgere noluit ulterius ad expendenda, quae
satis sciverat in tanta rerum penuria inveniri non posse, et decem millia
boum ab Incolis ultro oblata acceptavit. Tardabatur interim Pyrrhus impe-
diebaturque, navium maxime defectu, ad importandos Papho Arsinoen usque
adverso Lyco commeatus, ubi omnibus copiis ad conveniendum dies dicta erat.
Opportune comparari poterant haec navigia hyeme, atque, quo praecesserat,
vere, cum Coridon, Paphum inter et Cytlzaeram indecoro luxu tempus tereret3
