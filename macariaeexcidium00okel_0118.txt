1)111 that he would accept noe Authority from the Army or Nati0n; say-
ing that 110 might comand the Army as Lieutenant Generali, by Vertue
osa former Commission from szasis; he wondered the Officers would
presume to meet without his Orders, and he comanded them to disperse
and retire to theire respective Quarters. He was told by the Deputyes
there was noe such Thing as a Generall now; and indeed there was noe
Army, Amasis haveing already dischargcd them of their Alleigeance,
and given them Liberty to shift for themselvcs; and if they were left at
Liberty to submitt to the Encmy, sure they had the same Freedom to
defend themselves3 and if Tyridates could 1101 accept the chief Com-
mand uppon those Terms, they were oblidged by the Law of Nature to
take the best and most proper Methods they could fix uppon for Seli·-
preservation. But Tyridates gave them noc other Answer that Day. The
next Morning, (after 110 consulted his Directors)‚ Lysander found 111111
inore plyant3 he was satisfyed to have a Couucill of Officers for the

milite, Proceribns, et plebe delatam potestatem aequitati utique contrariam,
respuere: posse se nihilominus sumniam rerum usurpare, et sine ulla legum
offensione regimen exercere ς quippe qui jam olim paterno consensu exerci-
tibus praefuisset: sibi mirum videri cur, inconsulto se, convenire in unum, et
consilia statuere auderent: proinde abirent, atque in sua se hyberna, sine ulla
tergiversatione, reciperent. Ad hoc nihil asperitate verborum territi placide
reponunt, nullum jam in insula armorum Ducem 0550, ac ne exercitum qui-
dem, postquam Amasis cunctos sacramento exsolverat, libereque et pro arbitrio
permiserat, qua quisque tuto posset viai, sibi prospiceret: quod si liberum erat
in hostium se potestatem dedere, eandem esse certe libertatem potiore ratione
concessam, ut aeternos numinum cultus, regium jus, se, sua, patriam, et cha-
rissima pignora, vi et armis defenderent: porro si Tyrz‘dates oblatam imperii
summam hisce conditionibus acceptare nollet, teneri se naturae legibus, quo
maxime possent, rempublicam et communem omnium incolumitatem tueri.
Sed haec surdo frustra occinebantur‚ neque quidquam ultra a Tyriclate imprae-
sentiarum extorquere poterant3 quanquam insequenti die (posteaquam sci-
licet rem serit) cum Rectoribus contulerat), inclinatiorem eum facilioremque
Lysander comperisset. Tunc enim ad exequenda belli munia Ducum consilia
non recusabat3 in civilium rerum administrationem ex unaquaque Provincia
