This “m'glz an Hom- and an Hals,” according to the previously mentioned renewal of the
action by “five '¹ o¹elock‚ would postpone the general engagement, οι· that between the wings
and centres of the two armies, until about hoff-past sior. The Williamite Chaplain's narra-
tive of those Subsequent portions of the engagement between the respective centres, and the
opposite wings at Aughrim (as well as at Urrachrec) which made the action a general one,
supplies no particulars as to time, until, having related the fall of St. Ruth, and the pursuit
of the Irish troops of the centre, and of the wing at Aughrim towards Loughreagh, he returns
to what was doing at Urrachree, where the Irish last maintained their ground. Then he
says: ‘¹ During· alc mis Stir, ancl Nosse, on tlte Rsglzt and Centre uf [lle Army, those towards
our Lest, that first Engaged‚ kept their Ground, and not much Action happened there for near
two Hours pamm nor did the Danislz Horse and Foot, that were on the Left of all, disturb the
Enemy as yet, but stood opposite to several Bodies of Horse and Foot‚ that faced them on the
other Side the small Brook. But . . . . they then engaged them, and for about Ηαζί· (171 How·
there was pretty hot Work. But the Eneiuy, being then in a declining Condition, and pressed
hard on all Sides, they fied all out of the Field. . . . . Their Horse were pursued nigh three
Miles; but tlte Nzglzt coming on, with a thick Misty Rain, prevented us from getting between
them and a very Advantageous Pass, nigh Louglzreaglz‚” &c. By the eomputation of “ nem·

begin on the said right and centre until lzczlfpasl ,ςιζιἾ o'clorlt, the period of ‘⁴ near [ιι-ο Hamas-,⁸
and the additional one of “aboutllugfan IIonr'* of “pretty hot Work‚'' would malie the Irish ηοι
to have been defeated finally, 01· on their right at Urrachree, as well as elsewhere, until about
nine o'cloclc, and perhaps somewhat later, as would appear by the mention of ⁸· thlzt coming
ons· at that time of the year, which, according to our present mode of computation, was the
22nd of July.

The eommenccment of the general engagement between the two armies is assigned to the
same time as· Story assigns it, or about half-pasl m* 0¹0locl2· in the evening, by De la Brune.
⁴· On donna le signal de la bataille,'' he observes, ·‘ environ les ,ςιζυ lzezcres §- clemie, ao quel
temps toute Ζάνηιῦε Anglot'se sortit de derriere des rideaux οὺ elle etoit, ἃ ,ςάιταηεα ret-s [es

last of the Irish army that kept the field, or, as De la Brune designates it, “la cavalerie qui
eomposoit l'aile droite des ennemis,” the Huguenot writer says, that ‘⁵ enfin apres environ [soils-
beares de combat, elle commenfcc a prendre la suite, ce qui fut un signal assure de la ‹lefaite des
rebelles.'¹ According to the period above cited, as that at which he reekons the battle or gene-
ral engagement to have begua-mat Is, αόοιιί ltaljlpast sia: in tlte evenz'ng,-this commeneement
of the flight of the lrish horse from Urrachree after a combat (ψαῦσαί three honr-5, would have

of more day-light to follow up the pursuit of the Irish army, seems in accordance with liis pre.
vious assertions‚ on the other points in question. ‘⁶ On la pnursuivit,'‘ he observes, “ mais la
