When Ginkell had sofar advanced, that lzz's whole [γαίη ⁰f artillery could act witlz effect, lle
ordered it to open stre, and, as Ιιε had a vast number ofguns with him, he directed them co
play incessantly upon the Irislz ‚· hoping thereby to drz've them from the lzz'll, which was of
great advantage.

On the Williamite engraved “ Plan of the Battle of Aghrim,” General Ginkell is repre-
sented as having-four batteries planted against the Irish positiom two of those batteries to
play from his centre upon the Irish ceutre, over the bog between both ; and the two other
batteries upon his right wing against the Irish left wing at Aughrim. Of the total amount
of Ginkell’s gnus, we only know, that they were more than the Irish had, from the number
which one of Ginkell‘s officers, Major Robert Tempest, informs us were with the English
right wing alone towards Aughrim. The Major, having stated how his Genera] ordered the
advance, “ upon the right wing,'' of “the horse and foot,” adds: ⁶· and 12 pieces of cannon,
which were come up by this time, and played upon the enemy.” But while, in addition to these
twelve pieceS, marked in the Plan as two batteries, Ginkell had two other batteries, or those in
his centre¹¹‚ St. Ruth had, on the whole, but nine field-pieees. ⁶* The only thing which St.
Ruth wanted to give him the full advantage of such a situation,'' remarks Dalrymple of the
Irish position, “ was cannon : but he had only nine field-pieces with him.’‘ These guns are
marked, in the Williamite engraved “ Plan,'' as forming but two batteries, or half the number
of Ginkell's, represented, as has been said, atfour.

With reference to the hopes alleged to have been placed by the Williamite General in the
effects of his artsslery upon the 1rish, King James, after mentioning the first advance of the
English towards the Irish position, says : ‘⁴ They had no positive design to come to a general
action, but to try the countenance of the King's army, and to drive them, if possible, from that
post with their cannen, but,‘' adds the King, “ being once engaged and encouraged by their
former success, soon brought it to adecisive point.'' And this assertion of the royal Memoirs,
as to there having been “ no positive design to come to a general action‘’ at first, on the part
of the enemy, is confirmedby Major Tempest, who says of Ginkell : “ The General, advancing
forward upon a hill to take a view of the enemy, an outguard of theirs appeared, upon which
he ordered some dragoons to march towards them, and horse to follow ; butnot to engage the

enemy. Yet, however, the dragoons (being too forward) advanced up, and fired upon them :
