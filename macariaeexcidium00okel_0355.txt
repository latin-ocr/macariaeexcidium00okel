cent severe reverses at Derry and Newton-Butler, a force capable of opposing Schonberg,
the Irish Governor and garrison of Carrickfergus were directed, says their official authority,
“to divert the Enemy, and hinder him, by the longest Defence they could, from advancing
too soon towards the King.'' When, therefore, according to the same authority, Schonberg.
on the 19th, summoned the place to surrender, “the said Collonel Maoarty Moor‚'' we are
told, “ slighted the Summons with that Resolution and Brrwery, as became a good Officer and
a Loyal Subjeet. And the town was not, as Colonel O'Kelly's Latin translator, says, ‘⁴ taken
at the first attack.'' It was defended by Mac Carthy More, against Schonberg's operations
by land and sea, until the *2Tth of August, or eight days from its first investment. By
that time, being, in the words of the previously-cited official authority, “reduced to the
last Extremity, having hutone Barce} of Powder left, and without any Hope of Relief, he
(Mac Carthy More) then quitted the Town upon very Honourable Terms.” King James,
having mentioned in his Memoirs, how Marshal Schonberg “beseiged Caricfcrgus,'¹ adds:
“ and tho a very weak place was forced to attach it in form, and it defended it sels eight days,
a much longer time than any body could haue innnagined, kill'd a great many ofhis men, and
had good conditione at last.‘’ These ‘⁴ honourable terms‘' and “ good eonditions,” on which
Carrickfergus was surrendered to Schonherg, are published at length hythe Williamite
Chaplain, Story, who speaks ofthe Irish gai-rison as “ lusty, strong Fellows,’' and, says he,
“to give them their Due, they did not behave themselves ill in that Siege''⁰¹.

On Saturday the Tth of September, according to Story, Schonberg's army niarched to
Dundalk. It was found, he says. ⁴⁸ forsaken by the Enemy, and not burnt; tho‘ it had been
better for us if it had, as it fell out'afterwards ..... We Encanipt‚’' he adds, “ about a Mile
