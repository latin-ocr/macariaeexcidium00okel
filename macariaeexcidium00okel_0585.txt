last few years will all be available for the better execution of the extremely diffi-
cult task which they have umlertaken.

‘⁶ I would, therefore, recommend the Couneil to devote their energies 01100
more to the publication of Cormac's Glossary ,- and, if 110 pecuniary difficulties
arise to impede 0111· proeeedings, I see no reason why it should nothe com-
pleted within a year from the present time. As I have already stated, the
labours of the editors will now be facilitated in many ways. Resides having
gathered much additional information necessary for the illustration ofthe work,
they have profited by the recent discovery in the University libi-ary of a eopy
osa portion of it older by two or three hundred years than any to which they
previously had aeeess. Nor do I despair of their search for other copies prov-
ing successful. The importauee, and at the same 111110 1110 difficulty, of estab-
lishing a good text ofthe Glossary must be apparent, when it is remembered
that throughout it are scattered words in the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Anglo-
Saxon, Welsh, Pietish, and Icelandic languages, with the meaning of which
the transeribers of the MSS. now accessible to us were often unaequainted.
and therefore peculiarly liable to error in copying them.

‘⁶ ⁴ The Couneil may not think it out of place if I add a few words more
with reference to the general nature of Cormac’s Glossary ; they may help to
explain the manifold difficulties which attend the editing ofit.

“ ⁶ It was written nearly a thousand years ago by Cormae MacCuleannaiu,
King of Munster and Bishop ef Cashel, a man distinguished as the most
learned scholar ofhis ti1ue3 and we have reason to believe that it was intended
by him to be a glossar-y to the important· historical collection entitled 'I'lce
Psalter of Cusszel, which was compiled by his orders. The following is the
system of the work 1—After each word is given its etymology, both the meau-
ings of the roots and the languages to which they belong being indicated. In
many instances quotatious are added illustrating the 1150 of the words.

‘⁵ ‘ As regards the derivations‚ it is easy to conceive that they present fre-
quent difficulties to the editors. Sometimes the words employed in explana-
tion have themselves become obsoleto. Sometimes mistakes have been eom-
mitted by the scribes in writing the foreign words from which Cormac derives
the Irish 01105, or the roots have been referred to wrong languages.

‘⁶ ‘ The learning 111111 ingenuity ofthe editors will be 110 less severely tasked
