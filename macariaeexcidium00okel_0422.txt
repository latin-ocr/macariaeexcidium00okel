It is not true, that Cork was surrendered as Colonel O'Kelly says the English alleged it
to have been surrendered. On the esth of September, a breach having been made since the
day before, and the English arrangements proceeding by land and water for the storming of
the place, the Governor, Colone] Mae Eligot, beat aparley, and sent the Earl of Tyrone and

destroy the rest.''

“ The Irislz do grievously complain,'' adds Doctor Chai-les Leslie, “that upon the surrender
of Cork, the Irislz Army, tho* Prisoners of war, were, by the Conditions, to be well used,
