Distributioa ω] the estates of tlze Irish, by tlte English revolutiunary Parliament, cmzongst
English contractors, republican solcliers, und regicides.

The ⁶* contractors'' above mentioned were those English eapitalists, who, soon after the
Ulster insum-eonon in October, 1641, or upon the credit of two English Acts of Parliament
passed early 111 1642, advanced money for the subjugation of the Irish, on the condition, when
lreland should be conquered, of being repaid by large grants of land, from the confiscated
estates of the Irish Roman Catholics. ‘¹ It‚” says the historian, Borlase, “ was resolved upon
solemn debate, on the 8111 of December, 1641, by the Lords and Commons in the Parliament
of England, that they would never give consent to any toleration to the Popish religion in
lreland, or any other His Majesty's dominions.'· The author of the manuscript ‘⁴ Case of
the Roman Catholicks of Ireland‚” previously described, speaks. as follows, of the confiscating
Acts, which succeeded this resolution: “ This was but a pre-lude to 1119 two rigid Acts the
English Parliament pass'd in February and March following, for the confiseation of two
millions and a half of Irish acres. arable, meadow, and pastnre land, belonging to Irish
Papists, all the woods, boggs, and other land passing under the name of iinprofitable acres,
and belonging to the premisses, to be thrown, with the rest, into the bargain, and all to be set
aside as a fund for satisfaction, to such as would furnish money towards carrying on the war
against ye rebels of Ireland, this fund of confiscations to be made over and assign'd to the
Adventurers proportionably to their respective lones, when both Houses would alec-lare the leing-
(Ιοηι couquer'd.''

The writer of this manuscript then complainS, that, from “ the distinction the Acts made
between profitable and improfitable aeres, and the manner the later are superadded, without
any restriction or limitation,’' ALL the Roman catholic lauded propi-ietors of Ireland might
consider themselves as liable to confiscation3 though the Ulster insurrection was, he says,
little, isat all, extended beyond that provinee; and he then proceeds to make this view of
the matter inore apparent, from the localities assigned by the English Parliament for com-
pensation, in every province of Ireland, to English Adventurers, out of the lands of the Irish
Roman Catholics. “ But, to let them and the Adventurers see ye Catholics of the whole
kingdom were indistinetly⁷’ [i. e.without distinction] “ involv'd in ye calamity of these confisca-
tions, and that the people in arms in Ulster were not alone to suffer, that Parliament prodi-
gally settled for each Adventure
