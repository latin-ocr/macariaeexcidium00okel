pable of bearing children. His eldest daughter, too, was married to the
Prince of Patara, who was himself a lllurtanensian, and to whom, on
his fiither-in-law's death, the sucoession would, of unquestioned right,
devolve. But when Diana (that was the Queen’s name) proved unex-
pectedly with child, they recurred to their treason in good earnest, and
invited Theodoro (who had retired abroad) to take the place of Amasis,
when they had forcibly removed him. Iu the mean time, the Queen's
confinement, who, in solemn child-birth, had brought forth a son, gave

summis opibus conjurationem mutavere, et Theodorum, quem, spe regni oblata,
in partes pellexerant, Amasi vi exacto sufficere adnixi sunt. Reginae interim
