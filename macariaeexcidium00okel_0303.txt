Note-5 and I [lustratione. 271

From the new light which Mr. Lynch intimates that the Pipe Roll above-mentioned would
give respecting Henry's force, the publication of such a document, with proper notes and
illustrations‚ would seem to be very useful3 even if it were not the more worth editing from
the following observation of MrAEVright, in his introduction to M. Michel's edition of the
old Freneh poem on the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland under Henry ΙΙ. : “ It happenS,
unfortunately, that the rolls of the reign of the second Henry are nearly all lost. In the
reign of John, they first begin to be numerous, and they then throw great light upon Irish
history''‘'.

According to Dr. Lanigan, the Bull of Adrian IV. was never made public in Ireland till
the year 1175, when, in consequence of the resistanee displayed by the Irish to the Anglo-
Nox-man dominion, Henry's power there was reduced to a low state. Henry then sent over
Adrian’s Eun, as well as that of Alexander confirming it, for publication in Ireland, by
Nicholas Prior of Wallingford, and william Fitzaldelm. The Doctor states those docu-
ments, to have been first publicly read, at a meeting of Bishops,in Waterford. Nevertheless,
from the acknowledged vcorrespondence between the Papa] Court and the heads of the Irish
Church, on the very bad condition of the mass of their countrymen‚-from the alacrity with
which the Irish churehmen in general are represented to have submitted to Henry‚-and from
some statements of Hoveden and Gervase,-it is probable, though the Bull is alleged not to
have been published by Henry while he was in Ireland, yet that the substance ofit would be more
or less known to the Irish clergy, and that, through the influence of such a document upon
the clerical order, and their influence upon the native princes, that document may have so
far contributed to the ready submission of many of those Princes. The passages on this head,
from Hoveden and Gervase, have been given in Note 64.

Independently, however, of any share which Adrian's Bull may be supposed to have had
in promoting the success of Henry in Ireland, there are other reasons assigned by contempo-
rary Anglo-Norman chroniclers for that success. The King is alleged to have been invited
over by several of the native Princes and their subjects, to protect them against the hostilities
of Strongbow and his followers, and to assume the sovereignty of the island. Henry is likewise

affirmed, from the period os his landing in the country, to have endeavoured, and to have
