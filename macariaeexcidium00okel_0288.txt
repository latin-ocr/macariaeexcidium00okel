Abbot of Peterborough, in speaking of the decrees,
sor the observance of the lrish, passed by the Sy-
nod of Cashel, says: “ Praeceperunt etiam in illo
concilio decimas dari viris ecclesiasticis de omnibus
qua· possidebant. Plerique enirn illorum nunquam
decimas dederant, uec etium sciebant, si [Iure debe-
rent.” Cambrensis speaks of the Irish in ternis of
creat. severity, as connected with the charge ot*
their not paying tithes, &cuz “ Gens enim lia-c. gens
spurcissima, gens vitiis involutissima, gens omnium
gentium in fidei rudimentis incultissima z—Nondum
enin] decimas vel primitias solvunt.“ On the ac-
cusation of being “uninfornied in the very rudi-
nients of saith& thus associated by Cainbrensis
with the conduct of the Irish in not payiug the im-
post in question, Doctor Lanigan says: “ This
was, according to him, and the clergy ofhis country
and times, a violation of an article of saith! I
allow that the ancient Irish did not pay those dues,
nor were they in general paid in Ireland during
his time, except where the English influence pre-
dominated, notwithstanding the decrees of the
‹loun-:ils ot' Kells and Cashel. Giraldus did not
know, that such dues were not paid in the best
times of the Church, and that it was not until very
long after the days of St. Patrick that they were
introduced, and indeed first ot' all into France,
where they are now extinct. In Italy they are
scarcely known; and yet the Italians cannot be said
to be uninformezl in tlte very rndiments qffaitlt.’'-

¹¹ With respect to the objection made against the
lrish by Causprensis, partly connected with this
charge in the papal buu, that “ nec sacras Dei ec-

suorum

clesias et personas ecclesiasticas, prout debent,
aliquatenus reverentur,'' Doctor Lanigan says:
“ As u proot' of the Irish being rude in the princi-
ples offaith, he (Cambrensis) states, that they do not
frequent the church of God with due reverence.⁷'
But. replies the Doctor, “They entertained, I be-
lieve, as much respect t'orchurches as any cf their
neighbours, and he (Cambrensis) himself gives us a
proof of it, iu relatiug a custom followed by them
in forming confederacies, and pledging each other to
maintain mutual sriendship. They meet, he says,
in some holy place, and go round the church three
times3 after which, entering the church, they pre-
sent themselves before the altar, on which the re-
liques of saints are placed, and while mass is celebra-
ted, and holy priests praying on the occasion, become
indissolubly united. This practice shows,'' conti-

has related and lamented, that, in the rage of war,
the Irish, like other nations, sometimes profaned;
pillaged, and burned editices dedicated to religion,
though not, as the Doctor remarks, until after the
exercise of such demoralizing practices amongst
them, by the Heathen Danes. Some such conside-
rations as these would, indeed, appear to have
caused the remark against the Irish in the bull, as
regards the ‘⁶ sacras Dei ecclesias et personas ec-
clesiasticas,'⁷ to have been accompanied with the
qualifying term, ‘⁴ aliquatenus.’·-(Lanigan's Ec-
clesiastical History of Ireland, vol. iii. pp. 491-492,
