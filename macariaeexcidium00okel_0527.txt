A paragraph, headed, “Dublin‚ Dec. 293* in the London Gazette, No. 2728, states 1 ‘⁴ On
the 2ch of this Month, Sursfeild, with the Remainder of the Irish that designes] for Frauee,
set sail from C'orh, being in all about 2600, including [sumen (md Claz'lzlren. He thought to
have carried off with him a much greater Number, but many deserted himg· &cu

That Lord Lucan and Major General John W'auhop were under no necessity, from a want
of ship-room, to sanction such barbarous conduct to women as that attributed to them by the
Dublin Williamite newspaper, and copied by Story, would appear both from the last-cited
paragraph of the Lomlon Gmette, and from what Story himself says, about ‘¹ Lord thcmzfind-
ing that he had Slzips enough for all tlte Irish that were like lo gt) with him ;'' and his Lordship's
accordingly giving under his hand a Release, dated Sth December, 1691, to Lieutenant-General
Ginkell, for furnislfing, pursuant to Treaty, in addition to the conveyance supplied by the
French fleet, ‘¹ Shipssur as many ofthe Rest as are willing to go ,·'' namely, with his Lordship
himself, from Cork.

On the passage of women and children, as well as those in a military capacity, from Ire-
land to France, after the Capitulation of Limerick, the contemporary French historiam, Pete
Daniel, says of the French Admiral, that arrived too late with the French supplies, intended
for the relief of the place, “ ll ramena tous les Franeois, 16‚000 hommes de troupes Irlan-
doises, ἃ ρ]1ιείειινε]”(ιιιιίἰῖεε.” And the great Benedictine compilation, “ L'Art de Verifier les
Dates,” adds on the same point, ¹‘ M. de Chateau-Renaud passe en Irlande avec une escadre,
& ramene, au mois de Decembre, tous les Francois‚ 16,000 hommes de troupes Irlandoises, Sa
plusieurs familles fideles a leur Prinee, qui aiment mieux quitter leur patrie que de recon-
noitre un usurpateur''³'.

their plnnderecl countrymen, among whom they were lo ἱναυεί, and from whom they might

Dr. Charles Leslie, advertimg, in 1692, to the ravages of the Williamite war in Ireland,
speaks of the country, as ‘⁸ that W'ilderness and Desolation which we see it at this Day.” And
Story, in the edition of his hook, printed in 1693, referring to the wretchedness amongst the
Irish poor, the January aster the conclusion of the war, or that of 1692, says ; “ Α Man might
every where see a great many Objects of Pity, and Misery, and they continue so to this very

Day”'k.
