from ‘¹ an impossibility of continueing the war,'’ the manuscript says ι “ When the kingdom
was reduced to this extremhy, most of the army, ehoosing rather to quit their native country,
their wives, their children, and old decrepite parents, than live under the Usurper's tyranny‚
and withal being desimus to spend the remainder of their daies in their Prince's service, and
to let him see, by their constant adhesion to his interest aln‘oad, as well as at home, how ma-
liciously they had been aspers'd by their encmies, and misrepresented both to himselfand his
roial fatherf, they made formal capitulations, and were not, as Clarendon says, sold to foreign
l'rinces; hy which capitulations, they stipulated to pass, as they did, into foreign eountries,
especially France and Spain, where they stuck to no service nor bread but what squar-'d with
his interest, resorting and flocking to him from all places and engagemeMs, and siding chear-
snlly with ye Princes they saw favour'd most his interest. When he was in France, they
quitted the Spanish service and the sure bread they had on that side, to joyn him upon un-
certainties3 when he quitted France to live in Flanders under the protection of Spain, they
abandon'd what establisments they had acquired by their gallant actions in the Most Christian
Kings service, to be still near theh· master, doing him pleasure in the field, and supplying him
in his warns, as far as their pay and industry cou'd reach, and doing him all the good offices
that fell within their sphere or power z all which they did with such alacrity and zeni, such
love and duty, that his Majesty found himself in his banishment master of a considerable
body of an army, which made hini the more regarded abroad, and the subject of nourishing·
hope to his friends, and of anxious care and inquietude to his enemies at home.n
The importance then attached by the French government to the Irish regiments in its
service was so great, that, even after Cardinal Mazarin's treaty of alliance with Cromwell
against Spain, by which the Stuart family were to quit the French dominions, various efforts
were made by the Cardinal and Marshal Turenne to induce the Duke of York (afterwards
James II.) not toleave the French for the Spanish service. Nay, Cromwell's permission was
nsherl and obtained for the Duke to remain in the service of France; on account of the loss it
would he to the combined forces of England and France, and the gain to Spain, that the Irish
regiments should join the latter; as it was known they would, when the Duke and his royal
brother (Charles ΙΙ.) should be lmtlz under the protection of that power. This circumstance
is
the observation of Mac Geoghegan, “les Augluis
eurent ἓι peine mis le pied eu Irlande, qu'ils com-

ἴ Os the manner, in which it was §ought to

‘⁴ asperse'' aud “ misrepresent ’⁹ the Irish to

Fharles Ι., the King himself appears to have been
‹luly aware. For, it is remarkezl. in ΜΓ. Moore's
last volume ι “ Soon after the battle of Nuseby, a
manuscript copy was found of Sir Edward Walker's
Discourses ofthe Events of the Civil U'nr, in which,
amone, several other corrections in the King's hand-
writing, it was observed, that, in one place, where
the writer had occasion to speak of the insurgents,
and had styled them rebels, the King had drawn his
pen through the word ‘ rebels.' and had suhstituted
the word ‘ Irish ' in its stead.'¹ But, according to

IRISH ARCH. SOC-
