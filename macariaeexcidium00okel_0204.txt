the middle of the third century, by Carbry or Caii-bre Riada, who was chief of Dalriada, a
country so named from him, and comprehending a large portion of the present County Anti-im.
The name of Dalriada was transferred by this Irish colony to their settlement in North
Britain, and the posterity of Cairbre ruled over the two Dalriadas. The next and the most
important settlement from Ireland in North Britain took place about the year 503, under the
three sons of Erc, namely‚ Loarn, Pergus, and Augus, of whom the first took possession of
Loarn, so called after him, and the second of Cantire, while Augus is stated to have colonized
Ila. These colonies were subordinate to the Monarch of Ireland till the famous Council of
Drumkeat in Ulster‚ in the year 590, when Aidan, the grandson of Pergus, was freed-by Aodh,
or Hugh, then Monarch of lreland, from future homage to the Irish crown. The gradual en-
croachments upon and final subjection of the Pictish monarchy in North Britain, by the raee
of the Irish settlers, founded the modern kingdom of Scotland. This last exerit, or the
subjection of the Picts‚ was effeeted by the descendant of Fergus, Kenneth ΙΙ., son of Alpin‚

According to Charles O'Conor's genealogical table of the royal line of Scotland, from
Kenneth ΙΙ., the conqueror of the Piets, and, as such, the first Prince who reigned over the
chief portion of the territory comprehended in the modern kingdom of Scotland, James VI.
of Scothmd, or James 1. of England, the son of Mary, Queen of Seots, was the twenty-third
in descent from Kenneth 3 and the remaining portion of James's pedigree, from Kenneth up to
Fergus, may be seen in Chalmers's Caledonia. The other circumstances osJames's title to the
