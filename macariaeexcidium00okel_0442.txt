Of this gentleman, Lodge says: ‘⁴ Denis Daly, of Carrownekellyv, in the County of Gal-
way, Esq.‚ was Second Justice of the. Court of Common Pleas, and a Privy Counsellor in the
reign of K. James ΙΙ, He continued to fill this station at the Revolution, and with such im-
partiality and integrity (in those arduous times), as added lustre to his judicial character.''

The Judge does not, however, appear to have stood so well with the lrish or Jacobite side,
by which he rose, and on which he professed himself to be, as he stood with their opponents,
the English, or Williamites. On the 4th of May, 1689, he was impeached by the House
of Commons of King James's Parliament, and after the matter had been brought on and put
off in the House upon the 3lst of May and the lst of June, he seems finally, or on the 4th, to
have gotten out of the dilemma in which he was placed, by a mode, which would have been less
likely to succeed on the other side of the Channel, than on this. ‘⁴ The Commons Quarrel to
Judge Dully‚'' says a contemporary letter from Duhlin‚ dated June 12th, 1689, “ for which they
impeaehed him, was, upon some private Diseourse he had with Sir Alick Bam-k, and some
other Gentiemen, in which he disapproved of the Commons Proceedings, and said, they were
a Kind of Massanello's Assembly, and that it could not be expected that Men, from whom the

King took Estates. would fight for him, or to this Effectq. . . . . Τιιθειίαῃ, the 4th instant,
