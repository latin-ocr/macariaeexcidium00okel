his Memoirs, that ‘⁵ he only proposed to himself, since the inequality in numbers was so great,
to try if by defending posts, and rivers, he could tire and wast the enemies force, having ex-
perienced hy the foregoing Campagn, that nothing could be more fatal to them than delaysr·‚
thsv his own universall wants made that a hard game to play too.”

After mentioning how the King collected his army and advaneed in the month of June to
Dundallz, but that the enemy were as 45,000 to hut 2:3‚000 men, the Duke of Berwick says :
‘² Cette grande disproportion nous determina a tacher d'occuper quelque poste pour arreter
le Prince d'Orange, ou du moins le combattre avec moins de desavantage. Il fut propos'e de
se camper sur les hauteurs au dela de Dundalk, attendu qne le pays etoit assez difficile; mais
comme les ennemis‚ en faisant un petit dfitour, pouvoient descendre dans la plaine derriere
nous, il fut resolu de se placer (19111919 la ririere de Boyne. pres de Drogheda.''

The Duke of Berwick then intimates that this was done: “ Le Prince d'Orange nous
suivit‚ ἃ* 59 campa vis-a-vis de nous ;'' hut says no more than King Jnmes 01* than Story does, of
what the Latin version of Colonel O'Kelly would represent as ‘⁴ retreatiug by forced marches,
not unlike actual flight.'’ On the contrary, James relates how, while he was encamped for
some days, at Castletown-Bellew‚ or, according to Story, on Sunday, June 22nd, a party of his
men gained the first success over a detachment of William's. The royal Mernoirs, premis-
ing how William in the mean time was at Newry, “ during which time 119 sent parties to view
the severall ways‚'' add, “and it being observed that every night 119 sent one to a pass called
the Halfway bridg, to press a guard of hors and Dragoons the King had there, betwixt Dun-
dalk and Newry, his Mujesty order'd out a partie of hors and foot under the command of
Coll: Denipsy and L* Collonell Fitzgerald to ly in ambuscade, and if possible to surprize
them, which was performed with such success, that the Enemies partie of two hundred foot
and sixty dragoons fell into it at break os day, and were most of them cut off, the four Cap-
tains that commanded and most of the subalterns being either kill'd or taken prisoners, with
the loss of a few common men: on the King‘s side, only Collonell Demsy himself was wonded,
on which he died in two or three days afterwards?

James then remarks respecting this affair, and his retreat to the Boyne: “ This little ad-
vantage heartended the King's troops, and encreased the desire they had of fighting, bnt that
alter'd not the Kings resolution of avoiding a battle all he could3 and therefore being
informed that the Prince of Orange had prepared all things for his march, and resolued to
come streight to Dundalke, the King not thinking that post tenable against 50911 an Army, on
the 23²¹ retired towards Ardee, where his Artillery joined him, and haveing notice by his parties
and deserters that the enemy had passed the mountains between Newry and Dundalke, on the
'27¹¹‘ he retired to Dumlane, and the next day came to the Boin, and haveing passed that river,
camped just over against the bridg, his right towards Droghedagh and his left up the river,
and finding that post an indifferent good one (and indeed the Country ufforde-d no better) he
set up his rest there, and resolued to expect the Enemy tho he had not aboue twenty thou-

sand men, and the other between forty and fifty thousand. Wh
