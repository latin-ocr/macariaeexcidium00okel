The ῖαηιίἰηέΓ of William III. in Ulster,for the Campaign of lG90, 55·st

‘⁵ The King‚’' says Harris, “ set out from London sor Irelaud on the 4th of June (1690),
embarked at High-lalze on the l lth‚ and on the l4th lauded near Currickfergus, being attended
by Prinee George of Denmark, the Duke of Ormond, the Earls of Osset-cl, Porclaml, Scar-
borough, and Manchester, with many other persons of distinetion.''

The ‘⁶ Villare Hibernicum‚'' a contemporary Williamite account, after having stated how
William “about Three went a Shoar at the said Town,'’ observes: ‘⁶ His Majesty on his Land-
ing, immediately mounted, and rode on Home-back, through the main Street of the Town,
which was lined on both Sides with innumerable Crouds of People, who hid his Majesty Well-
come, with continual Shouts and AcclamatIOns: At the White-Hunse, half-way betwixt Car-
riekfhrgzts and Belsust, His Majesty was met hy the Duke of Schunherglz in his Coach and
six Horses; the King was pleased to a-light‚ and go into the Duke's Coach, attendcd only with
one Troop of Horse, and a few Gentlemen, and immediately drove over the Strand to Belflcsl.
The Uncertainty of the Time, and Place of his Majesty's Landing, and the Suddenness of the
News was such, that few ofthe Multitude that Flocked to Belfast to see it had their Ends, the
Generals Motion was so quick ; yet before they got into the ann, there were Abundance that
met them, and coming to the North-Gale, He was received by the Magistrates of Belfust, in
their FormalIties‚ a Guard of the Foot-Guards, and ageneral continued Shout, and Shouts of
God save tlte King, God hless ουν Ρνωῐεείςιηί King, Gocl bless King ll'z'lliam. His Majesty
went directly to the Castle, which had been some Time before prepared for him, where he
alighted and went into an Apartment appointed for him ...... At Night‚” it is added, ‘⁸ the
Streets were filled with Bonfire-works, which were no sooner lighted‚ but the Alarm Signal
was given by Diseharge of Guns, so planted, that from one Place to another of the Armies
several Winter-Quarters throughout the whole Country in our Hands, in a few Minutes, all
Places had Notiee of the King’s Arrival, and in a very few Hours made Bontires so thick, that
the whole Country seem'd in a Flame; so that the Enemy could not but see, and conjecture
the Cause, to their eternal Grief.’'
