Notes and I [lustratione. 473

lorsqu'on voit un homme engage dans un mauvais parti, s'y tenir dans l'adversite‚ comme
dans la prosperite‚ le deffendre avec courage, & avec perseverance, on ne peut s'empecher de
l'honorer de son estime, pendant qu'on lui refuse son amitie. Je suis persuade que leurs
Majestez Britanniques ont plus fait de cas du Comte de Tyrconnel, tout ennemi qu'il etoit,
que de l'Amiral Torrington, ἃ de quelques autres qui lui resemblent. On estime partout la
vertu, meme dans son Ennemis·

On the rzmzour of poison alluded to by Colone] O'Kelly‚ and other reports mixed up with
it, and conveyed by deserters to the English camp, respecting the last illness of the Duke of
Tyrconnell, Story, in notieing the Duke's death, adds: “which some say was not without
Suspition os foul Play, in being poisoned with a Cup ofRattafetzu, this is Nothing but Apri-
cock-stones bruised and infused in Brandy, which gives it a pleasant Relish‚ some ofwhich
my Lord Tyrcannell had given him at an Entertainment; and falling ill upon it, he often re-
peated the word, Rattqfeau, which made several believe that he had received Poyson in that
Liquor, because he would not comply with the prevailing Faction then in Town. But most
People say, that he died of a Fever''¹.

Then, respecting the Duke's politioal character, the Williamite Chaplain observes ε “ How-
ever it was, he certainly had managed the Affairs of that Kingdom, from his Entrance upon
publici< Business to his dying Day, with as much Dexterity and Zeal for the Interest he pre-
tended to serve, as any Man could have done”¹¹¹.

Richard Talb0t‚ the subsequent Earl and Duke of Tyrconnell, was, according to Cau-te,
“the youngest son of Sir Willimn Tullmt, a Lawyer. and a man of good parts who, by his
prudence and management, had acquired a large estate.” Sir William was one of the Agents
commissioned, with a Deputation of the Roman Catholie Nobility and Gentry of Ireland. to
lay the complaints of themselves, and their fellow-subjects of that religion, before James 1., in
connexion with what they arraigned as Sir John Davies's unjust obtrusion into the Speaker-
ship of the Irish House of Commons in 1613, and the other grievances under which they con-
sidered themselves labouring, as the members of that Church, and of the great body ofthe Irish
