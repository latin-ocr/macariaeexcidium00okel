The feelings of the Irish on the matter are thus noticed by a hostile or Williamite con-
temporary:—-“ Before l take leave of our supposed Prince of VVales's birth, I must not omit
to acquaint the render of the universal confidence of all the lrish in the kingdom, that the
Queen (as soon as ’twas said she had conceived) was with child ofa son. This they were so
certain of, that they would lay you twenty guineas to one, or any other wager in proportion
to that, from the highest to the lowest amongst them. This confidence was much wondered
at by the English, andjudged to be very unreasouable,” observes this writer, with regal-d to
the Anglo-Protestant settlers 111 1191111111 ; “ which, when the English inquir'd the reason of‚’'
the Irish, he 1111115, “ attributed their great assurance to the prayers of their infallible Church,
which were daily offered to God upon this account, and would undoubtedly meet with a suita-
ble retu1·n”·¹.

The Queen of Jnmes II. delivered [gf [ι Son.

The Queen was public-ly delivered, at St James's Palace, June loth, 1688, of the Prince
of Wales, who was christened by the names of James Francis Edward, 111 1119 chapel of
that palace, 011 the 15111 of the following October. Dalrymple, after 1911111111,Γ how this birth
osa son to the King occurred during the celebrated proceedings against the Seven Bishops,
marks how unwelcome the production of such an heir to the crown was to the disaffected
feelings of the Protestants 111 England. ‘¹ Rumou1·s‚··he says, ⁸⁶ were immediately spread, and,
as men easily believe what they wish, were greedily received, that the birth was an imposture.
Many falsehoods were invented and circulated to increase the suspicion; and, according to the
nature of credulity, in times of high passion, the 111051 improbable were the most believed.
Even men of sense and of eandour seemed to have lost their superiority of mind in the pre-
judices of the vulgar. The vulgar even fell below their ordinary deficiency of common un-
derstanding. They believed, that the fireworks, prepared in honour of the Princo of Wales's
birth, were intended to bombard the city, 111 revenge for their rejoicings upon the deliverance
of the Bishops. And, as 111911 111 terror are prone to superstition, the sky happening, on the
night of the fireworks, to be alternately obscured by clouds, and inflamed by lightnings‚ they
cried out, ‘that this was an expression of the Almighty's indignation against the imposture
put upon the Protestaut heirs to the throne: Few,'' he adds, “ reflected how unlikely it was,
that James should stifle the voice of nature, to injure his daughters‘, who had never injured
him. It was said, ¹ That one who had broken saith with his God in changing 1115 religion, and
with his people in invading the constitution, was become insensible to all the ties of nature? ”
