Thomas Crofton Croker, Esq., among the Transactions of the London
Camden Society‚ in the volume 6111111611, ‘⁶ N arratives illustrative of
the Contests in Ireland in 1641 and 1690.” There was not, 111 fact,
any such 111116161106, between the M S. used by Mr. Croker, and the
Trinity College MS„ as would have justified the expense of printing
the latter, after the publication of the former.

In the 0011156, however, 01 1842, the attention of the Irish Archaeo—
logical Society was again directed to the BIacarioe Eaecisliwn, by the
discovery 01 1116 MS. containing 1116 Latin version, which is printed,
along with the English, in this volume. This Latin copy was then in
the possession of the Rev. Jaines Scott, R.C.C. 01 Carnelnnacross,
and since 01 Clones, County Monaghan, by whom it was first submit-
ted 10 1116 Editor. According 10 1116 testimony 01 that gentleman‚ this
MS. had formed part 01 a collection 01 books belonging to Dr. Daniel
O'Reffly, who made his collegiate studies partly at Antwerp‚ partly
at Douay'·¹; was ordained Priest in 1728 3 was President‚ 101· several
years, of the Irish College at Antwerp3 and ultimately Roman Catho-
lic Bishop 01 Clogher, from about 1748 10 1776. The Latin copy was
transmitted from him to another Dr. O‘Ressly, also a President 011116
111511 College at Antwerp‚ as well as Bishop of Clogher3 then to the
Rev. Hugh O’Reilly‚ likewise President of that College, and some
years since R. C. Parish Priest of Carrickmacross 3 from him it de-
volved to his niece, and 11011] 1161 10 1116 Rev. J ames Scott. Mr. Scott‚
in a letter addressed in 1842 to the writer of these lines, having made
known the general nature of the Latin MS.⁷ and obligingly forward-
ing it to him 101 inspection‚ 116, perceiving how much 111016 matter
it contained than the MS. printed by the London Camden Society,
subinitted the discovery thus made 10 1116 Rev. ›J. H. Todd. Dr. Todd
brought the subject before the Council 011116 111511 Archaeological

Society‚
