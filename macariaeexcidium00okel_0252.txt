successor, or Tanist, was, during his lifetime, assigned to him, by the same process . . . .
For the succession to the minor thrones, a similar provision was made 3 to every petty king a
successor was, in like manner, appointed, with powers proportiones] to those of his chief3 and
thus, in addition to the constant dissension of all these princes among themselves, each saw
by his side an adult and powerful rival, chosen generally without any reference to his choice
01· will ; and, as mostly happens, even where the successor is so by hereditary right, forming
an autliorised rallying-point for the ambitious and disafl'ccted,

¹· So many contrivances‚ as they would seem, for discord, could not but prove successful.
All the defects of the feuda] system were here combined, without any ofits atoning advan-
tages. It is true, that an executive composed of such dividedand mutually thwarting powers
must have left to the people a considerable portion of freedom ; but it was a sreedom, under
its best aspects‚ stormy and insecure, and which life was passed in struggling for, not in en-
joying. The dynasts themselves, being, from their position, both subjects and rulers, were,
by turim, tyrants and slaves : even the inonarchy itself was osten regarded but as a prize to
the strongest3 and faction pervaded all ranks, from the hovel to the. supreme throne .....
Among the numerous occupants of thrones», the tenure of authority and oflife was alike brief;
and it is coiuputed that, of the supreme kings who wielded the sceptre, before the introduc-
tion of Christianity‚ not oue-seventh part died a natural death3 the remaining sovereigns
having been taken off in the field, or by murder. The same rivali-y, the same temptations to
violence, were in operatIOn throughout all the minor sovereignties ; every provincial king, every
head of a sept, had his own peculiar sphere of tui-balenae, in which, on a smaller scale, the
same scenes were enacted 3 in which the law furnished the materials of sti-ise, and the sword
alone was called in to decide it'ff. See Note 55.

The old Irish alleged to have been so qam-like, that even the Romans [lid not venture to molest
them.

“ It cannot but be acl<nowledged‚” says the writer previously cited, “that the conduct of
the Romans, respecting Ix-eland, by no means warrants the supposition, that they held its con-
quest to be at all an easy task. The immense aslvantages that must attend the acquisition
ofa country placed so immediately in the neighbourhood of their British possessions, were,
we know, fully appreciated by theim nor could any views be more keen and far-sighted than

, those of Agricola, as unfolded by Tacitus, both as regarded the commercial strength that must
accrue to Britain from the occupatiori of Ireland, and the strong moral and political influence
which the example of this latter country must ever exercise, whether for good or for evil,
over the fortunes of her more powerful neighbour. He saw that the Erimus, says the histo-
rian, could never be effectively curbed, as long as there was a people yet unmastered in their
neighbourhood3 and that, to effect this object, the example of liberty must be removed
