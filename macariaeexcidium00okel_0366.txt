King James II.‚ ΜΓ. Macpherson, who first made them generally known, by abstracts taken at
Paris, and printed in 1775, says: “ lf the Memoirs of King James cannot raise their author to
the rank of a fine writer, they certainly do him credit as a man. There is an air of veracity
in all the accounts given by that Prince, that is much more valuable to an intelligent mador,
than the choicest flowers of rhetoric and best turned periods. Indeed the manner in which
the papers, called his Memoirs, were written, precludes every suspicion of unfaithfulnes on his
side. His notes were generally made upon the spot; and always before there was any neces-
sity to palliate the circumstances os the transactions related. Besides, he was not of a com-
plexion to misrepresent. He affected to guide himself by principle in all his actions ε and to
deem the slightest deviation from truth a crime. In his opinions he is frequently wrong, but
very seldom in any fact that fell within his own immediate lmowledge.‘'

Of the King's attention to writing while in Ireland, the same historian asserts: ‘⁴ That
Prince usually wrote, with his own hand, all the occurrences of the times, or examined and
corrected what was written by others. He sometimes wrote down his instant reflections and
conjectures on the state of his affairs, and the expected effects os his mensures, without waita
ing to see what time might determine. The pen must haveheen 001151111111)Υ in his hand.''

Of King James's Memoirs the originals are related to have been unfortunately destroyed
at the time of the first French Revolution3 and we have at present only a compilation from
them, obtained, after much trouble, from Italy, and published by command of His Royal High-
ness, the Prince Regent (subsequently King George IV.>, in 1816. But, as this compilation
purports to have been made from the King's original Memoirs and other papers, not only
under the sanction of his son, Prinee James Francis Edward Stuart, (or the Chevalier de

St. George), but is, moreover, interlined and corrected by 1110 hand of that Prince, the work

may, under such circumstances, be regarded, and has accordingly been cited, in these pages‚
as the Memoirs of lx'ing Jaines ΙΙ.·1

J ames's conduct towards Ι reland asserted, lo lawe been anrz'butable to his haring been persuaded
by bad advt'sers, that, lo gain Englaml, he should lose Ireland, since the English would no!
recall him, like hels- brother, charles IL, while he should be at the head ofcm Irish and
French army.

From some years devoted to the investigation of documents connected with the reign of
James II. in lreland, the Annotator ofthis work may be allowed to observe here, oncefor all,
that he has never met with any foundation for the notion, that the King thought his English
subjects would be the more likely to recall him to his throne in England, if he had lost
Ireland. Neither, on the other hand, has the Annotator met with any evidence to countenance

what Harris, &c.‚ as well as the Author, have alluded to, as an intended cession by James 11. of
Ireland
