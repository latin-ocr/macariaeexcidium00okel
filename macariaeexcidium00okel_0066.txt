Exciclium M acarioe ,· or,

33. Amasi& now finding his Mistake of the good Opinion he con-
ceived of his Subjects in Saty-aelius, retired back to Salamis, where he
eonvoked the States of the Kingdom, and spent in vain Consultations
the whole summer Season, which might be better employed to goe on
more vigourously with the Siege of Satraclnm, the only considerable
Place in Cyprus that owned the Authority of Princo T lieodore. In this
Convention of the States, Amasis could not be perswaded to abrogate
the impious Laws which were enacted by Queen Eleusina against the
Worship of Delphos, and the spirituall J urisdiction of the Arelz Flamin,
least it might alienate from him the Hearts of his Alsartanesz'cm Subjects
in Cilicia, whom he alwaies courted; and it was not without some Regret‚
that he consented to abolish that unj ustDeeree of his Brother, P ytlzagyoras‚
which confirmed to the Ciliciam Rebels the Lands of the loyall Cypriam,
formerly given to them by Attilas, and his regicid Ciliciam Senate, when,
after murthering Pyt720907²as the First, they declarcd against Monarchie,
and sett up a Commonwealth3 and it is much doubted to this Day (if De-
ruamus, Embassador of Syria, had not warmlyinterposed,1ninding him
often of his Engagement to Antiochus, to redress the Injustice done to his

33. Amasis deprehenso tandem inconsultae credulitatis errore, et expe-
rientia comperto, quantum Satrachenz's fidendum essct, opinione frustratus
Salamina revertitur. Convocatis ibi regni ordinibus, totam eain aestatem con-
sultationibus minime necessariis, velut in summo otio, et belli securus ab—
sumpsit, cum satius longique utilius foret Satracho, qua una tum omnium
leeodorz' partes fovebat, acriter impigreque oppugnandae incumbere. In his
comitiis induci non poterat Amasis, ut injustas illas leges antiquaret, quas
Eleusina adversum Delphicas ritus, et Arclzfflamz'nz's authoritatem tulerat, ne
Martanesz'ormn animos, quorum favorem aperte ambibat, averteret, irritaretque:
nec nisi mente sane reluctante, atque aversa voluntate iniquissimum illud de-
cret-um convelli ac rescindi passus est, quo Pythayoras secundus in perduelles
Cdicas fidissimorum Cypriorum agros fortunasque transtulerat, quorum posses-
sionem ab Attila tyranno et nefario illo Senatu acceperunt, praeminm scele-
rum, postquam Pythagora primo per facinus obtruncato, sublatoque regno,
trucem illam libertatem, atque infandam Reipublicae speciem constituissent.
