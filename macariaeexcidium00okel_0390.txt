joyned those of the Count tle Sehonberg,” adds, concerning this retreat of the Irish horse and
French foot beyond Duleek, after thejoining of the whole of William‘s force for a pursuit‚.-
“ The Enemy retired about three Miles further, and there posted themselves in a very advan-
tageous Place; and the King followed them with his Horse and Dragoons, and Orders were
given to Attack them there, but it being very late, and the Fight having lasted from Ten in
the Morning till Nine at Night, His Majesty did not think fit to engage the Troops any farther,
but ordered the Horse and Dragoons to remain in Arms all Night :‘’ διο.

Story, on this retreat of the Freneh foot and lrish horse, asserts: “I enquired at (of)
several, who they were that managed the Retreat the Ιι-ἰΑΙι made that Day so much to their
Advantage, for (not to say worse of them than they deserve) it was in good Order so far as
we could see them (l mean with the Horse and Frmzclz Foot) whatsoever they did afterwards 3
but l could hear of none in particular,'’ exc. And, in the second portion of his work, having
related thejoining of the whole of the retiring Irish force at Duleek, he speaks of what he
considers the incompleteness of the victory, on account of the obstacles presented by this re-
treat. ‘⁴ Our Army‚'' says he, “then pressed hard upon them, but meeting with a great many
Difficulties in the Ground, and being obliged to pursue in Order, our Horse had only the
Opportunity of cutting down some of their Foot, and most of the Rest got over the Pass at
Duleek‚- then Night coming on, prevented us from making so entire a Victory ofit, as could

have been wished for'''¹.

Colonel and his Militia returned, and, as will pre-
