“ To Nial thc Great succeeded Dathy (A. D. 400), the last of the Pagan Monarchs of
Ireland, and not unworthy to follow, as a soldier and adventurer⁵ in the path opened to hi1n
by his heroic predecessor. Not only, like Nial‚ did he venture to invade the coasts os Gaul;
but, allurcd by the prospect of plunder, which the state of the province, then falling fast into
dismenilwrment, held forth, forced his way to the soot of the Alps, and was there killed, it is
said, by a flash of lightning.'' A. D. 428.

The circumstances of this Irish Monarch's death, and of the conveyance. ofhis body back
to Ircland, as related by the Mac Firbises‚ together with very curious particulars respecting
the locality of his interment at Roilig· na Riogh, or the ancient sepulchre of the Kings of
Connaught. near Rath Croghan, County Roscommon, are given in ΜΓ, O'Donovan's valuable
contribution to the Transactions of the Irish Archaeological Society, entitled, “ The Genea-
logy, Tribos, and Customs of Hy-Fiachrach,” ἃς. Ductor Mathew Kmnedy, Judge of the
Court of Atlniiralty, and Master of Chancery, in Ireland, during the reign oszunes IL, in
his “ Chronological‚ Genealogical, and Historical Dissertation of the Royal Faunily of the
smnus? publishesl at Paris in 1705, says respecting the termination of Dathy's life and ex-
pedition, in the Alps ;-“ The Piedmontois tradition *of this matter, continued to this day,
fully agrees with our account of this expedition.'' The local source through which a know-
ledge of the existence of that tradition was acquired‚ or a nobleman of the great family of
De Sales (variously styled in the writers of the time, Marquis, Count, aml Bai-on), appears
fron] Ahhc· Mae Geoghegan, in his Histoire de l'Irlande. ‘⁴ La relations⁷ lie observes, ‘¹ de
cette expedition de Dathy, dont parlent presque tous les livres Irlandois, se trouve conforme
a la tradition Pii-inontoise„ et a un tres-ancien registre des archives de la maison de Sales ou
il est dit, que le Roi d’Irlande s'etoit loge dans le chateau de Sales lors (le cette expedition.
Je tiens cette relation de Daniel ὁ Mulryan. Capitaine au Regiment de Mount-Cushel⁵ qui
m'a assuri¹ l'avoir oui dire au Marquis de Sales, lorsqu'il etoit ἐ table avec Miloni Mount-
Cashel, dont il croit le prisonnier depuis la bataille de Marsaille.‘' The Abhz· is correct, as
to a nobleinau of the house of De Sales having been a prisoner to Justin Mac Carthy, Lord
Mountcashcl, in tlw war between Louis XIV. and Victor Amadeus, Dulze of Savoy. He is
only mistalzen, as to the time and place he assigns sor the fact, which occurred, mtt at the battle
of Marsaille, or Orhassam October 4, 1693, in Piedmont, but in Savoy‚ during the campaign
of 1690, at an encounter where Lord Mountcashel and his regiment were present, fighting,
under Saint Ruth, against a body of Mondovisiens, the subjects of the Duke of Savoy, com-
manded by De Sales. The Dutch Mercure Historique for October, 1690, thus relates the
circumstance, on the Allied side, after notieing how Saint Ruth (the same who fell next
year in Ireland at Aughrim) was employed in reducing Savoy :—“ Il y a eu un combat
entre un detachement de ce Genera] et douze. cents hommes de Mondovi comnmndez par le
Comte de Sales, qui furent rencontrez entre Saint Jean de Morienne et Constans''-or rather,
Conflans. ‘¹ Les Mondovisiens se defendirent d'abord avec beaucoup de courage, et tuerent
un assez grand nombre de leurs ennemis, mais enfin ils furent obligez de ceder au nombre,
apres avoir perdu beaucoup de monde. Les Irhmdois, commandez par Milord Moneassel,
