advantagious Post, and after that another, till being beat from Ditch to Dsteh, they were
driven up to the Top os the Hill of Kz'llltomodon, where their Camp had laid, which being le-
velled, and they exposed to our Shot more openly, they began now to run down right; the Foot

The Duke of Berwick‚—respecting whom, it should be premised, that not having been in
Ireland from the February previous to the battle, or ever after, he was necessarily indebted for
his account of it, and of St. Ruth's conduct there, to others, and that this account, from its being
at variance, as well with the general tenor of the Jacobite information in the royal Memoirs.
δια, as with the several details here given out of the Williamite writers, probably emanated
from the French General's party adversaries, or the supporters of Tyreonnell against him,
but, at all events, as NOT being the result oftlze Duke’s own personal knowledge, ean be of no
more authority than it may be found to possess, after being tested by the other Jacobz'te and
Williamite evidence, quoted from Note 234 to the present—the Duke ofBerwick, under these
qualifying circumstances, affirms of St. Ruth at Aughrim: “ Il etoit sort bien poste, ayant εἴ
quelque distance en avant un marais impraticable a la. cavalerie, hors sur les chaussees qui le
traversoient. ll efit pu aisement les empecher de passer3 mais il avoit tant d'envie de batail-
ler, qu‘il repeta le meme dictum du Marechal de Crequiz Que plus il en passeroit, plus il eu
battroit; ἅ* cela lui r‘eussit aussi de meme. Les ennemis passerent tous, Sc se mitent en
bataille sans etre inquiete& alors il les attaqua. Son infanterie d'abord poussa celle des enne-
mis: mais bientot elle fut ramenee a son tour: ses deux alles de cavalerie furent aussi battues;
sur quoi voulant aller chereher son corps de rseserve, qui n'etoit composee que de six eseadrons,
il fut emporte d'un coup de canon, Sc l'armee du Roi ne songea plus qu‘a se sauver. Plu-
sieurs personnes ont publie que, s'il n’avoit pas ete tue, il auroit gagne la bataille; maisj’en
fais juge le lecteur. Lui auroit-il ete possible, avec six est-adrens, de retablir une affaire
deja perdue'? Tout ce qu'il auroit pu faire, c’efit ete de faciliter un peu la retraite ; ce que
firent les Officiers Generaux apres sa mort.''

Captain Parker, however, who fought upon the Aughrim side of the field, or opposite that
quarter ofit where St. Ruth fell, after relating how “ St. Ruth was taken off by a cannon
ball‚'' alleges of the state of the action when the French General met his death ι “ It was at
a very critical juncture, when his orders were much wanted ; for their center and right wing
still maintained tlzez'r ground ¹¹; but seeing their left put to flight, and not having orders from
their General, they soon ran into confusion, and were put to a total rout ..... Had it not
been that St. Ruth fell, it were hard to say lzow nmtters would Ιιιιυε ended .· for to do himjus-
tice, notwithstanding his oversight at Athlone, he was certainly a gallant, brave man, and a
good Officer‚ as appeared by the disposition he made of his army this day. Had he lived to

had been done against the Irish right at Urrachree, ²¹ See also the extract from the Captain to the
in the passage commencing, “ During all this Stir, same effect, at the end of Note 236. ”
