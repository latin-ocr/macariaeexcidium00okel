his courage, abilities‚ and tried loyalty, observe : “ To him therefore the King gaue a power
to regulate the troops, to place and displace whom he pleas'd, which he executed very much
to the King's satisfaction and advantage, tho not so to the Lord Leiftenant‘s‘3 who besides
that he look‘d upon it as a diminution of his own authority, was vex'd to see so many Catho-
licks put into the Army, but the King had reason (as he sayd himself in his letter on that occa-
sion to the Lords Justices) to believe that Monmouth's rebellion had spread its contagion into
that Country‚ that it had infected many and deluded more: tis certain the Protestants of Ire-
laud being much addicted to Presbitery, even of the Cromwelian stamp, were but too succep-
tible of such impressions¹'‚ and by consequence the Army stood in need of being purged from
that dross, wherein no other method was used than what had been formerly given in too and
aproued of, by the Duke of Ormonde himself, tho not perform'd by him before he came away,
which was only to turn out all such, or the Sons of such, as had serued in the Pax-liment or
Cromwelian Army, no one could wonder the King should think those persons not the fittest to
be trusted with the deffence of his Government who had the guilt of his Father's blood upon

Militia armes (which were generally in their possession too) were only taken from them to be
put into the magazines ς which my Lord Primat himself enter'd so far into the reason of, as
to exhort them to it by an elegant speech he made for that purpose, telling them, They could
not do more prudently, than to deliuer up their armes to be placed in his Majestys Stores
where they would be in greater readiness for the militia and their owne defence, than dispersed
about as they then were3 which they performing accordingly, and their example being fol-
lowed in most other places, added no little to the peace and tranquility of the Kingdom. But
these proceedings were no ways liked by My Lord Clarendony he would not suspect those per-
sons Coll: Talbot thought fit to turn out, tho the seque] shew'd of what disposition they were,
when once they had liberty to act according to their own inclinations: but the King conceiud
what had been done to be both just and necessary,'' &c-

Irish in general, as well as of the Earl of Tyreonnell himself, when Viceroy‚ in connexion
with that measure. ‘¹ They,'’ says the Doctor, respecting the Irish, “generally swore, with
the most bloody Oaths and bitter Imprecations. that they would never subject themselves to
