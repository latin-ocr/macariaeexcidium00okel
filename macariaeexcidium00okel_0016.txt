iv Editor’s Preface.

the completion of the translation into English by ΜΓ, Kelly, that gen-
tleman, having learned that a MS. os the 11[αε(,1νὶα’1 Excidium was in
the possession of his kinsman and friend, Count O'Kelly Farrell, 111
Franeess, it was then determined not to put the work to press, till all
the known copies of it should be consulted and compared. Mr. Kelly
therefore obtained from the Count his MS, accompanied by a short
meinoir of Colonel Charles O'Kelly, which has been made use ofin
that written for this volume. It now appeared, from a collation ol* the
Count's MS. with the others at the disposal of the Society, that there
was not sufficient reason for considering the Latin as the original os
the work, and therefore an arrangement 111 printing it, different from
what was first intended, was adopted, with the consent, and even at
the suggestion, of Mr.Kelly. According to this arrangement, that
portion only of Mr. Kelly⁷s task has been retained which contains
the translation of the outline of Irish and British history, prefixed,
in the Latin, to the immediate subject of the illacarice Eaecz'clium, or
is a version of some circumstances in the subsequent portion of the
Latin, which seemed fit to be introduced into the English text. T 0
preserve a due distinction between thal text, and the additional matter
so introduced, such matter has been enclosed in brackets.

The English text of the Macar-[ce Eiecidi'wn, or os Colonel O'Kelly's
history properly speaking, and which begins at paragraph 31, page 32,
of this edition, has been selected by the Editor, with the aid 01” the
Rev. J. H. Todd, from four MSS. in that language.
