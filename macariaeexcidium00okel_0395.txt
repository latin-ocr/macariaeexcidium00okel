T lze ane of Tyrconnell stated to have (lone everytlzing, to induce his countrymen, instead of
relying on France for aid, ellat was tlzen barely able to defend herself} rather to treat with
William, who would probably grant any conclitz’ons, sooner than be detained, by a war in
Ireland, from attacking France on tlze Continent.

JameS‚ along with what he tells uS, of the Court of France, on his return from Ireland
after the battle of the Boyne, being in so ‘⁴ disponding” a mood respecting hwland, as to con-
sider, that any supply sent there would be only thrown away, also informs us, that, for the
purpose of landing in England, in consequence of Tourville's defeat of the English and Dutch
fleets at Beachy-Head, “ he made use of the first occasion to press his being allowed to goe
aboard the (French) Fleet, but his Most Christian Majesty replyd, That would signisy nothing
without land forces which he Sayd were not to be sparetl. because the Duke of Bandenburg
threatexrd to join Count Waldeck with his troops.‘’ This, James remarks, ‘⁴ was but a poor
evasion to answer a certain demonstration, that the King's landing in England would hinder
the 1³⁰⁹ of Orange and fourty thousand men from joining the Enemie in Flanders the ensuing
Campaign, would probably break the neck of the war, and lay his enemies at his mercy, which
he fail'd not to urge, but the Court of France was so disponding in the matters* &c.

Of the assertion of Louis XIV.‚ that Zantlforces could not be sparecl, even for invading Eng-
land, at atime the French were masters of the sea, and the island was drained of regular troops
for William's army in Ireland‚ James, as we find by a citation in his Memoirs, wrote word to
the Duke of Tyrconnell, so early as the 24th of July. William did not encamp before Limerick
till the 9th of August. In this interval, especially at such a fine season, James’s letter could
reach Tyrconnell. The opinion, which the French Officers seem to have entertained, as to
the impossibility of supporting a contest in Ireland against the English and Dutch, without
greater supplies than it would be expedient for France to give, has been already referred to.
Under such circumstances, therefore, the Duke of Tyrconnell nzz'glzt think he best consulted
the welfare of his countrymen. zf he could induce them to make peace with William, from
whom, under all the circumstances of his situation, it was not unnatural to expect eligible

terum, in consideration of the submission of Irelandw. See Note 152.

Tne generality of the Irislz nation unwilling to trent at all with William, as not expecting the

The general belief, on the part of the Irish‚ that there was no confidence to be placed in '
any compact which might be entered into by the English with them, has been popularly ex-
