lee Treaty of Limeriek, designated by Colonel O'Kelly's Latin translator, “ ignominious terms
asymam, or (more trztly) qftlte lzarslzest slavery.’'

This Treaty, and the conduct of the Iri>hi11 obtaining it, under the circumstances in which
they were placed, are very differently spoken of in King's James's Memoirs. ⁴⁵ Notwith-
standing the ill situation they (the Irish) were in, their forts taken, a breach made, and their
condition, in short, desperate; yet they had the courage to insist upon, and the dexterity to
obtain, articles not only for their own secui-ny, hut which had a respect to the whole King—
dom, consulting in the first place the King's honour and advantage in getting permission to go,
and even shipsr to transport them and all others into France who were desirous to follow
their Prinee's fortune and adhere to liis Seruice; which, with what went before, broughtinto
that Kingdom first and last near 30000 1ne1r3 in the next place they articled for as free an
exercise of the Catholici< religion as in King Chai-les the Secoud's time, and a promis to pro-
cure α further securityfrom any disturbant-e on that account ; that all the inhabitants of Lime-
rich, all Officers, SoldierS, δὶα, in the Army, Garisons, or Countys of Limerick, Clare, Kerry,

professions, possess their goods, Catties, δια, as before the war, and in fine a general indemp-
nity for all such as had been concerned in it.'⁷ Then, in reference to the subsequent violation
of the terms of the Treaty‚ which, and not the Treaty itself, was connected with what Colone!
O'Kelly's translator styles‚ “ the harshest slavery,⁷' the royal Memoirs add: “Which had the
English kept as religionsly, as such agreements ought to be observed‚ the world had not seen
so many crying examples of antient and noble fainelys reduced to the last degree of indigence‚
only for adhereing to their Prince injust defence of his right, when he came in person to de-
mand their succour, which all Laws both lnunain and divine obliged them too3 sor even that
senceless cantword of Abdicatiom which was the poor and only excuse for their unnatural
rebellion in England, had not the least shaddow of pretext in Irehmd, unless the King's colne-
