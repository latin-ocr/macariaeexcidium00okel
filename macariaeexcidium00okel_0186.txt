between them and the Towne. On the 24th‚ the Captains within Paphos
sent out a Trumpet, desireing a Parly with some of the Generall Officers
in the Ciliciam Camp; and after a short Conferencc between them, a Ces-
sation of Arms was agreed unto by both Partyes, for 3 Daies, [and hos-
tages exchanged] ; whereof Scilla had N otice given him that very Day⁷
and over Night he received half a Dozen safe Conducts‚ signed by
Ororis: they came in Blank to Scilla, and he filled them up with the
Names of the Dcputyes, who, next Morning, went to Paphos. The
Treaty began on the 26th Day, and continued till the 31·d of the 8th
Month, and then it was concluded, to the Satisfaction of some, and to
the sensible Affliction of others. But that which raised the Admiration

pacis conditionibus agitari coeptum est, tenuitque ea consultatio ad tertium
