Society, os which body the late laniented Professor Mac Cullagh, of
Trinity College, was at that time an active member. With that ho-
nourable zeal, on this, as on other occasions, for the preservation os
national remains of art or literature, which too many of far larger
means, (and those unarmed) would neither have the spirit to feel, nor
the generosity to imitate, Dr. Mac Cullagh, unwilling that a document,
connected with the illustration of the history of the country, should
be transferred elsewhere, purchased the Latin MS„ in order that, after
publication by the Irish Archaeological Society, the original might be
deposited in the Library of the Royal Irish Academyh.

In October, 1842, the Rev. J. H. Todd, Secretary to the Society,
addressed a letter to the writer of these lines on the subject of the
Latin copy thus discovered, in which communication he observed:
‘⁵ The Council have desired me to return you thanks for the interest
yon take in the welfare of the Society, and to ask of you the further
favour of undertaking to edit the book sor us.''

This request was acceded to; and the Latin MS, under an ini-

(the descendant of Lieutenant-Colonel John Kelly, brother to Colo-
nel Charles, the author,) for the purpose os being translated by hiin
into English. In 1843, the whole was translated, and transcribed for
the press, by that gentleman. The copy thus made was placed for
annotation in the hands of the Editor in 1844, and the “ Notes and
Illustrations” were finished by him, and deposited with the Secretary,
the Rev. J. H. T odd, in December, 1846. Subsequently, however, to
