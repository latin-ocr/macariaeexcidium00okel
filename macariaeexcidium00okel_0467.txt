Aughrim army, at the same number as the Bishop. De la Brune's statement relative to that
point, in his narrative of the battle, is: “ L‘armee Irlandoise etoit plus forte que celle des
Anglois d'environ 8000 hommes‚” or, in other words, Ginkell's army, to St. Ruth’s, were
as :20‚000 to 28,000 men.

Another contemporary Williamite account in Freneh, published in Holland, would like-
wise make Ginkell's force at Aughrim, compared with St. Ruth‘s‚ as ‘20‚000 to 28‚000 men.
That account affirms, of the Irish army there: “ Ils etoient plus forts que l'Armee Angloise
d'environ 8000 hommes.”

Captain Parker, already noticed as having served in that campaign under GinkelL states,
of the respective amount of the forces, with which Ginkell and St. Ruth opened the campaign:
“ About the middle of May, General Ginkle assembled the army near BIuIlingar, which
was eomputed to be about 23,000. The Irish army‚'’ continues the Captain‚ “ was assembling
at the same time on the other side the Slzmznon, near Αίῆῖοηθ, and was esteemed to be muclz
about our number.'‘ In his description of the contest at Aughrim, where he was present, the
Williamite Captain makes no remark, as to the comparative numerical strength of either side¹
So much sor the assertions of such contemporary Williamite authorities on this subject, as
render it unnecessary to notice any of the repetitions ofsubsequent compilers.

With regard to the opinions, entertained on the Jacobite side, concerning the amount of
their own army, as compared with Ginlzell's, between the fall of Athlone and the battle of
Aughrim, Story’s assertion as to the Irish infantry in the battle having been “nigh 20,000‚” is
neither countenanced by the statement of King James’s Memoirs‚ nor of Colonel O'Kelly. The
royal Memoirs, in mentioning the retreat of St. Ruth, after the loss of Athlone, to Aughrim.
say: “ In this retreat the Conough regiments grew very thiu, so that the foot by desertion
and maroding was reducedfi·om 17000 to about 11000 men.'¹ Colonel O'Kelly, as will be seen
in the text, reckons this arm ofthe Irish force at Aughrim still lower, or as only “ about 10‚000
Fuot.” The Jacobite or Irish infantry there would consequently be, by their own accounts,
but about 10‚000 or 11,000 men. The Irish cavalry there, of both kinds, heavy and light, or
“horse and dragoons‚'' according to the language of the dayp, are rated hythe ColoneL
our only Jacobite authority cn the affair, at 2000 of each denomination, or 4000 in all. Hence,
the whole of the Irish army sor the engagement, as represented by tlzeir authorities at 10,000
or ll,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry, would be no more than l4‚000 or 15,000 men. From a
statement on the subject by O'Ha1101-an‚—who, having been born at Limerick‚ the Irish head-
quarters, only about 37 years after the war, may have spoken with many of the Irish who
took part in it,--it would seem as if the higher amount, or 15‚000 men, was what the Irish
traditionally considered themselves to have been at Aug-brim, and that they rated their oppo-
