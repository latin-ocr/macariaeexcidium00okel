be made by the editors. With a view to diniinish the hinderanee arising from the
last-mentioned 0111150, a manuscript in the Bodleian library, containing more
than 111111ἱο1Ἰ the Glossary, was collated in the year 1844 by ΜΓ. O’Donovan‚ who
was 50111 10 Oxford by the Couneil for that express purpose. The editors now
recommenced their labours. Notos were made in illustration of the greater
part of the Glossary, and forty pages of it were actually printed off. The
Couneil, therefore, felt themselves justified in announcing, at the General
Meeting in December, 1848, that Corinae's Glossary would be the Society's
publication for the following year.

‘⁴ ⁶ At that time, the Secretary having requested 1110 10 1155151 him in per-
’1111111111ξῆΤ 1115 part of the editorial 11111105, Ι took 0011511101111110 pains to collect
inaterials which might enable mc to discharge this responsible task. But when
I came deliberately 10 form an estimato of the amount oflabour to bc gone

put 10 press as 1110 book for 1849.

‘⁴ ί Although the printiug of Cormac’s Glossary has 110011 111115 interruptet]
for a time, no small progress has been made during the past year 111 collecting
materials necessary for 1110 illustration of it. Mr. Eugene Curry, during 1115
visit 10 1110 Β1111511 Muscam last summer, had an opportunity os copying a
valuable and very ancient Glossary, which will be of the greatest use 10 1110
editors. The labours os the same scholar, in preparing a Brehon Law Tract
for publication, at the instance of the Couneil of the Royal Irish Aeademy,
have also furnis-hed him with the means of explaining several legal ternis

“ ‘ The widely-extended researehes of Mr. O’Donovan have likewise made
him master of additional materials, which will be of the utmost value.

“ ‘ So fin· then am I from regretting the slow progress which has been
made in editing this work, that I expect the 11051 10511115 will reward the
