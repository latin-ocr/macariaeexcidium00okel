GinlzeZL June 30271‚ detaclzes 8000 of his best troops to attach theford, who, passing the river,
enter tlte town (as it is said) without any oppositum ,- the Irz‘slz regiments who were to defend

the passage, being surprised through tlte (alleged) neglect or treachery ⁰f their commamliug
officer, stlaoewell.

After the defeat of Ginkell's attempt upon the place on the 29th of June, by the burning
of his “close gallerie,'’ already mentionedy, “it was generally believed on both sides? says
Captain Parker, ‘⁴ we should make no further attempts here, but endeavour to pass at some
other place. And indeed it looked something like it, for next day we were drawing off our
cannon and mortars, and all combustible matters out of our trenches, and that, after such a
manner, that the enemy might easily perceive it.”

Harris, having observed, that, for the attaek which was secretly preparing by the English,
“the General (Ginkell) commanded, that the detachment drawn out the day before should be
brought down at six in the evening, being the usual hour of relieving the Guards, that the
Enemy might have no suspicion of the design, which succeeded accordingly‚'’ adds: “As a
lucky Omen to the attempt, two Officers from the enemy at this junctiue swam over the river,
and assured the General, ‘ now was his time; for that the Irislz were mighty secure, thinking
the destruction of the works on the bridge would certainly oblige them (the English) to draw
off, and that it was impossible to attempt passing the river in the face of their (the Irish)
works, especially as their army was so near ; and further, that 3 of the most indifferent Irislz
Regimentsz were only then upon guard, the rest being secure in their camp.’ All circumstances
coneum-ing with the inelinations of the brave Commanders, the signal for passing the River was
to be the tolling of the Church Bell. About 2000 detached Men were prepared to be com-
manded by Major General BIaclcay, assisted by Major General Tettau, the Prince of Hesse,
and Brigadier ἷα Μείίοφιίενε, Major General Talmach going also a Volunteer with a party of
Grenadiers commanded by Col. Gustavus Hamiltmffi. The signal being given six minutes
after six o'cloek, Captain Sandys and two Lieutenants led the first party of sixty Grenadiers,

2 King James (as well as the Duke of Berwiek,
hereafter quoted), states those Irish regiments to
have been but two, instead of three. “It was‚''
observe the royal Memoirs, “ an additional missor-
tune to the King‘s affairs (which always contribi—
ted more to the enemies success than their own
vallom· or experienee) that there happen'd that day
to be upon the guard two regiments which con-
sisted most of νει-ναῖε, who making hut a feeble
resistance, the enemie soon made good the passage,

enter’d the Town and obliged the garison to retire
to the eamp.'’-—(Memoirs, vol. ii. pp. 454-455.)
