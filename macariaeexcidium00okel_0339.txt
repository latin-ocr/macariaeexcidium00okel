none of the old Proprietors were restored: in fine, those crying unjustices in the origin were so
fully represented to the King, and he at the same time as good as tould underhand, that if he
consented not to it, the whole Nation would abandon him, there was a sort of necessity of con-
tenting them, but at the same time for the quiet of his Conscience, and to keep cleer from all
apcarance of unjustice under so harsh an alten-natiue, his Majesty consider'd the prospect he
had of reprizeing the Purchasers out of the present forseiture53 for in the first place the greatest
number of thern were iu actual rebellion, and their clames extinguished by it, and such as
were not, the forfeitures of others might be sufficient to compensate, and accordingly an Act
of Attainder was passed against all such as were 111 actuall Rebellion, or had withdrawn them-
selves out of the Kingdom‚ unless they return to their Country and duty in aeertain time pre-
fixed, to surrender themseves: so that having well weighed the reasons on all sides, the neces-
sity on one hand, of not disgusting 1115 Irish Subjects on whom he wholy depended, and the
prospect he had on the other hand of recompensing any one who suffer'd undeservedly. deter-
min'd his Majesty at last to give his Royal assent, tho he saw plainly it was hugely prejudicial
tobis intrest.

power of pardoning those comprized in it'’j.

James, who, on one hand, was thus aocused of not doing enough in favour of the Irish Ro<

of the members of that faith, at the expense of the Irish Protestant Church, and its clergy,

‘¹ ang James,“ as the MS. Caso of the Roman
Catholicks of Ireland‚ p. 124, observes, “ was driven
(en tliyz'eus Deis) to seek Sanctum-y fromthat very
Nation, that had been so injuriously treated by the
Throne, and so shamefully sufl'er'd to be trampled
upon.'' And hence, too, we find, that, hy the pro-
visions of the Irish Parliament for the reversal of
the Act of Settlcment, this grant of Irish lands
which had been made to James, as Duke of York,
was to be resumed, and an equivalent given to his

Majesty, from the properties of those regarded as
