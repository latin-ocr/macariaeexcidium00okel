Having observed in reference to france, that, after the various efforts made for centuries,
by the Church, by voluntary 115509111110115, 111111 by the royal power, to put down “private wars⁰
there, all of which efforts proved ineffectum, that Charles VI. had, in 1413, to issue “an
0111111111109,9Χρτ9551)1 prohibiting private wars‚ on any pretext whatsoever,'' Dr. Robertson ex-
claims :—·‘ How slow is the progress qf reason and ofcz'vil order! li'egulations, which to us
appear so equitable, obvious, and sumpla, required the efforts ofcz'vil aml ecclesiasticalauthority,
during several centaries, to introduce ancl estublialz them.'' Yet, ‘⁴ even posterior to this pe1·iod‚''
he adds, that ‘⁶ Louis XI. was obliged to abolish private wars in Dauphine, by a particular
edict, A. D. l45l.‘’

After noting, that it would add too much to his work, “ ifhe should attempt to inquire, with
the same minute 111191111011, into the 111-1181955 of this μὲι-11191005 9115111111, in the other countries
of Europe,'' the Doctor says, with respect to “ private wars'' in Spain, 111111, “ 111 casule, the
pernicious practice of private war prevailed, and was authorized hy 1119 9115101115 111111 law of
the kingdoni‚''-that‚ “as the (311511111111 nobles were no 1955 1111111119111 than powerful, their
quarrels and hostilities involved their country in many calamities,''—that, ·“ 111 Magon, the
right of private revenge was likewiae authorised by law, exercised in 115 full extent, und ac-
coxnpanied by the Same unhappy consequences,'‘—and, in fine, 110111111151111111111ἕ the efforts
made in Spain, for several centuries, '⁶ to abolish the right of private war,''-.that ¹⁴ the evi]
was so inveterate, that as late 115 Α. D. 1519, (the Emperor) Charles V. was obliged to publish
a law, enforeing 1111 former regulations, tending to suppress this p1·aetice.''

The 5111119 historian, even after what he has stated of the consequences υἷ’* the right ot'
private war* in France and Spain, 1111115, that *· in Germany, the disorders and 91111111111195 occa-
sioned by the right of private war were greater 111111 more intolerable 1111111111 any other country
uf Europe-:¹ He asserts that. with reference to the imperial authority, ⁶· not only the nohility,
but the cities, acquired almost independent power, 111111 5130111911 all subordination 111111011911191199
10 the laws.'' He alleges, too, that ⁴‘the frequency ofthesefieitloe, 01· private wat-s, is often inen-
tioned in the German annals, and the fatal effects of 1119111 are most 111111191191111)1 described?
Then, having mentioned the different efforts made, from time to time, to remedy such 11 state
of things in Germany‚ he informs us, 111111 “ the final and perpetual abolition of the right of
private war‚'' in that country, “ was not accomplished until 1⁴95.''

On the ‘⁶ private wars‚¹' then, of the Irish chieftains with each other, at the head of their
little ‘⁴ nations‚‘' as each of them consideredhis olan or followers to be, nojudginent 511011111 evm·
be passed, without likewise taking into account, how long ‘⁸ private 11111115η continued to exist on
the Continent, and how difficult it was found, even there, to effect their final abolitionk.
