“ And whefher he (the said Mr. Pultinger) did not send Notice of this to the Belfast Mer-

chants‚ and others theu in is'cvtland? And though few or none of then] came over till after

The same authority, besides the instances he gives on the part of KingJames's Lieutenant-
General, Hamilton, and other Irish OfficerS, to protect the Protestants of the North as far
as possible, mentions this further precaution of Hamilton, to prevent disorders by the armed
Irish peasantry, or Rapparees. After his defeat of the Protestant Revolutionists at Dromore,
March l4th, 1688-89, ‘¹ Lieutenant General llamilton,” says Leslie, ⁴* willing to protect the
Protestants, as well as others, who would live quietly3 and having· granted his Protection to
Belfast and other Places, as before is told, and keeping his Soldiers under strict Discipline;
yet found the Country molested with Irish erpperees, οι· Half-pike-men, as they called then];
whom. when his repeated Orders and Proclamations could not reclaim, and Soldz'ers were not
in all Places at hand to defend the Country from them, and the Country were afraid to fall
upon them without order, lest it might be construed a Taliing Artns against the KIng; the
Lieutenant-General, for the greater Security of the Countryy gave Orders to the Country to
seize any such Bapperees, who had no Coinmission, and to commit them to the next Gaol;
and, if they made Resistance, to kill them.’'

after the revolutionary war,—“ Had the Protestant Officers of King le'llitmz's Ariny been as
careful of their Fellow Protestunts in that Country, Ireland had not been that Wilderness and
Desolation which we see it at this Day. It,·· he continues, “ isjust and commendable to give
our Enemies their Due, and not to conceal or lessen what they do worthily, because they are
our Enemies. Many of the Irish Officers were kind to the Protestauts, not only in making
good their Protections to them, but even where they had no Protections, and were perfectly
at their Mercy. [could give‚'' he concludes, “many Instances which Ι have heard from
the Mouths of Protestant Gentlemen and Ladies, who remained in Ireland while King dames
was there, of the great Civility of several of the Irish Officers to them‘'1¹.
