of C'orzl‘lon's Creatures3 and it is unlikely he durst venture playing such
a Prank in Cyprus without his Countenance. Lysander accused him, a
few Days before, in the Generall's Presence; and it was not prudently
done, after giveing him such a publick Affront, to intrust him with the
Command of a Post of that Importance3 but it seems coridon would
have it soe, and Pliyrrus did not think fitt to disoblidge 1110 Viee Roy.

Lycus, even at Ars-Inoa, ancl within Sight of the Cypriam Camp, asto—
nished all Men, especially those who were not acquainted with the
Intrcigue. It bread a generall Consternation over all Cyprus, that a
Gate should be opened into Paphia, which was the last Refuge of the
Nation: it made the thinking Men give all for lost. But none was
more sensibly afflicted than brave Plzyrras, who owned that, tho' he

ut regio Gubernatori rem tantillam obnixe adnitenti resisteret.
