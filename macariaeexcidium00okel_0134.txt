67. About the Beginning of the 9th Month, Lysander happily disco-

vered a (langerous Correspondenee and private Treaty between some of

1

. the Cypriam Senat and the Enemy. These were to eross the Lycus, and the
Conspirators were to order it soe, that the Cityes of Paphos and Cythera
should be delivered to them. Uppon this Discovery‚ Lysander posted
to Paphos, to give Tyridates an Aecount of the T reachery He shewed
him a List, come to him out of Salmnis, of the Traytors' Names3 and tho⁷
. TyridaCes owned the Receipt of such an other List from Amasis, which
came to him out of Tarsus, he could not, however, be perswaded to se-
cure the Conspirators (because they were all Com'don's F riends), and it
was by much adoe that he was prevailed uppon to disniiss Biz-ems from
his Office of Secretary‚ and to take the Government of Cythera from his
Brother-in-law‚ a good Connnander, raised, by Meritt‚ from a private
Soldier to the Offioe of a Tribune: he was generally held an honest Man,
. true to his Country, and zelous to the Delplziean YVorship, and noe

other Motive to remove or displaee him, but that he was allyed to

Riverus, who was really esteemed by a great Many of his Compatriots.

67. Ineunte nono mense Lysander haud irrito successu periculosa consilia,
et clandestinas negotiationes quosdam inter Cyprios Senatores, et hostium
Duces detexerat. Convenerat quippe ut his Lycum amnem transmissuris
Conjuratores Paphum et Cytlzoeram urbes in manus traderent. Conspiratione
itaque patefacta Lysander, quantis poterat itineribus Paphum adequitavit, ut
ordine proditionis seriem Tiridati aperiret. Tum libellum ad se missum Sala-
mine porrigit, in quo perduellium nomina descripta erant. Quanquam vero
Tiridates consimilem se libellum ab Amasi recepisse non diffiteretur, qui
Tarso venerat3 induci tamen non potuit ut reos aut custodia cingeret, aut
carcere includeret (omnes nempe Coridonis amici nominabantur) et vix a re-
luctante impetrari poterat, ut Moerum, qui regni a secretis erat, loco moveret;
aut praefecturam Cytlzoeroe urbis sororis ejus marito eriperet, strenuo sane ae
peritissimo Duci,quem spectata bello virtus e gregario milite ut Tribunatum
evexerat: 1160 ille ambiguae ante fidei habebatur3 charitatis quippe 111 pa-
triam notae, et'religionis Delphica> promptus atque acer propugnator; nec alia
causa suspicionem moverat, quam Riverz' affinitas, quem soli etenim natales
