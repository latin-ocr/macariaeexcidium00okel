King indeed had done it to his hand before he came, by convinceing the Court of Franco, how
great a pitty it were, not to second the Irish valour‚ when it gaue such hopes of nientaining that
diversion which was so beneficial to them3 so that My Lord Tyrconnel had nothing remain'd
but to get the grant exacuam, wherein he shewed himself a diligent and active Courtier, tho
now an old and infirm man, and gain'd so much credit with his Most Christ. Majesty, as to
be heard by him in person (his Minister being present) and to ohtaIn in great measure what he
asked, as to cloathes, linnen, corne, arms, officers‚ and some little mony, upon condition he
would return immediately himself, and then they promised these things should follow. Ac-
cordingly Monsr St. Ruth, Tesse, d'Vson and several other officers were sent some time. after,
togethar with what was promised in great measure; but his Most Christian Majcstys Orders
therein, were so ill observed‚ that the Irish received not the relief their necessitys required, nor

The Dulce of T yreonnell‘s voyage to Franee thought by some, to have ανὶςεη, from a necessity, υιι
his part, to remove unfizvouruble impres-siuns entertained towards him at tlte Frenelz Court,

and even by King ιῙαιηεε lzimselfifor advising lzim to leave I reland, 50 ,ςουιι after the Bam&
oftlze Boyne.

The King states, of the advice given him to leave Ireland for France, after the battle of
the Boyne: “ That councel was no doubt too precipitate, and itis wonderful on what grounds
My Lord Tyrconnel thought fit to press it with so much earnestness‚ unless it was out of ten-
derness to the Queen, who he perceiued was so apprehensiue of the King's person, as to be in a
continual agony about it; she had frequently beg'd of him to have a special care ofthe King’s
safety, and tould him, He must not wonder at her repeated instances on that head, for unless he
saw her heart he could not iinniagin the torment it suffex-'d on that account, and must allways
continue to doe so, let things goe as they would 3 and owned afterwards that tho she was in the
last extremity of grief at the loss of the Ratae, and that nothing could be so afflicting to her as
after haveing broke her head with thinking and her heart with vexation at the King’s‚ her
own, and her friends utter ruin, without being in a condition to relieue them, yet, that it was
an unspeakable alleviation that the King was safe, for that had she heard of the loss of the
Battle before that of the King's arx-ivan, she knew not what would haue become of her, and
therefore acknowlidged it none of the least obligations to him and Monss Lausun for pressing
his Majesty to it; for tho she confessed it was a dismal thing to see him So unhappy as he
was in France, yet in spight of her reason, her heart She sayd was glad he was there.

⁴⁶ Tho this sollicitude for the King's safety which seem‘d to stifle in some sort all other
consfflerations, was not only pardonable but commendable in the Queen, yet those who ought
to haue made his own well being, and that of his Subjects, togather with his honour and repu-
