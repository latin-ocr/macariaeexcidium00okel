declared himself a vassal of Pope Alexander ΙΙΙ. This nonsense, of the Pope's being the
head owner of all Christian islands, had been partially announced to the world in a bull
of Urban 11., dated A. 1091, in which, on disposing of the island of Corsica, he said, that
the Emperor Constantine had given the islands to St. Peter, and his vic-ars. (See Flcurgh
l. 64, ξ S.) But Constantine could not give what did not belong to him, and accordingly, as
Keating argues (book 2, p. 3), could not have transferred the sovercignty of Ireland to any
Pope.'' Nevertheless, this bull of Adrion—‘¹ by the tenour of whicl]‚” says Mr. O'Conor of
Belanagare, “ Henry was commissione-d, lilze another Joshua, to entcr Ircland in a hostile
manner, and put the inhabitants to the sword‚ for the good of religion, and the reformation
of manners,”-was confirmed by another bull from Adrian's successor, Alexander 111„ which
runs as follows:

⁸* Alexander Episcopus, servus servorum Dei, charissimo in Christo filio, illustri Anglorztm
Regi, Salutem et Apostoliccim benedictionem.

‘¹ Quoniam ea quae a decessoribus nostris rationabiliter indulta noscuntur, perpetua me-
rentur stabilitate firmari ; venerabilis Adriani Papae vestigiis inhaerentes, nostrique desiderij
fructum attendentes, concessionem eiusdem super Hibernici regni dominio vobis indulto
(salva beato Petro et sacrosanctae Romana> Ecclesiam sicut in Angli& sic et in Hibernis& de sin-
gulis domibus annua unius denarij pensione) ratum habemus et confirmamus, quatenns climi-
natis terrae ipsius spurcitijs, barbara natio, quse Christiano censetur nomine, vestra indulgentia
morum induat venustatem: et redacta in formam hactenus informi finium illorum Ecclesia,
gens ea per vos Christianae professionis nomen cun] affectu de cetero consequaturss'

Dr. Lanigan, after noting how the attempts to disprove the authenticity ofAlexander'S, as
well as Adrian's bull, have been equally unsuccesssul,—how Alexander, in hishull, confirms his
predecessor's grant of Ireland‚ ‘⁶ under the former condition ofthe payment of the Peter-pence‚‘'
-and,likewise, how Alexander's bull expresses the wish “that, on eradicating· the dirty prac-
tices of Ireland, the nation may, through Henry's exertions, become polished, and its Church
be brought to a better form,'’ observes of Alexander—⁴⁴ He seems to have known nothing of
the state os the Irish Chureh, except what he heard from the lying accounts of the enemies of
Ireland; and as to ecclesiastica] or other dirt,’' continues the Doctor‚ “ Ibelieve he might in
those times have found enough of it, and 1 fear more, nearer home, without loolzing for it in
this country. I dare say he would have been hard set to meet with, in any equal portion of
the Church ofthat period, so many excellent Bishops as Gelasius, Laurence O'Toole, Christian
of Lismore‚ Catholicus of Tuam, &c. There is nothing in the briefconcerning any letters οι·
other papers sent by Irish Archbishops and Bishops to the Pope,‘' concludes the Doctor, “and
the only authority alleged for Henry’s right to Ireland is the Bull of Adrian.” However, that
it was nat from the mere ‘⁵ lying accounts of the enemies of Ireland‚'' but from no less autho-
rities than those “ excellent Bishops‚'· Gelasius of Armagh, Laurence of Dublin, Christian of
Lismore, and Catholicus of Tuam, accounts wana dispatched to the Papal court, respecting
the existence of a state of demoralization, that would tend to excuse the notions of the Popes,
