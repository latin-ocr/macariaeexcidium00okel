222 Notes and Illustrations.

“ Such 11 course of discord and faction, prolonged‚ as it was through centuries, could
not fail to affect materially the general character of the nation, and to lay deep the seeds os
future humiliation and weakness. A people, divided thus among themselves, must have been,
at all times, 3 ready prey for the invader: and the fatal consequences of such disunion were
shown most lamentably, a few centuries after this period, when, as we shall 588, to Irish assis-
tance alone were the Danish marauders indebted for the footing they were able to maintain,
so long and ruinously‚ in the country. By the 5111118 causes though existing, perhaps, in a
much less aggravated degree, were the Celts, both of Britain and Gaul, brought so easily
under the dominion of the Romans. The politic use to which the rival factions among the
Gauls might be turned could not escape the acute observation of Czesar 3 and history, which
has left untold the name of the recreant 111511111311, who proffered 1115 treasonable services in
the camp of Agricola, has, with less charity, recorded that ofthe British chief, Mandubrafius,
who, from motives of mere personal revenge, invited Caesar into Britain⁰¹n

Nevertheless, when all the unfavourable circumstances connected with the situation of the
Irish, as 50 primitive, remote, and secluded a people, are fairly allowed sor, that their conduct,
in this practice of making war on each other, was CERTAINLY not worse than that of other
European nations, is evident from the continuance of “private wars'' down to a comparatively
recent period among those 113110115, notwithstanding every effort of the spiritual, as well
as teniporal power, to put a stop to such (10018515, 311(1 1118 crimes and miseries, necessarily
accompanying 1118111. The following representation, for instance, by Vostnire, “de 111. France
