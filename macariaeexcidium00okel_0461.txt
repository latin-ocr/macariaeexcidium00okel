found when the English made their assault on the place, it is as evident, that the Irish
soldiery were taken by surprise, as Colonel O'Neill and Colonel O'Kelly represent them to
have been. The Williamite Captain, who was was himself with the body of troops appointed
by Lieutenant-General Ginkell to make that assault, having mentioned how the signal was
given, says: “ On a sudden we bounced over our works into the river, and were α good way
on bejbre tlte enemy pet-ceizved us. This rouzed them as ic were out of sleep, and they began

This likewise appears to have been the fact, from what Story alleges of the small loss of
the Williamites in carrying the town, which he makes 10 have been but forty-six in killed and
wounded: amongst whom no more than twelve were slain, and thirty-four hurt. ‘⁵ We lost,'’

Colonel O'Kelly's account of this Scotch officer is, to say the least of it, ineorrect. Tho-
mas Maxwell is related to have been of a very good family in his native country; pro-
·bably a branch of the Maxwells of Nithsdale. Previous to the retirement of King James 11.
into France, or on November leth, 1688, he was appointed in England Colonel ofa Regiment
of Dragoons (the present Fourth Dragoons, or Queen's Own Regiment), in place of James
Berkeley, Viscount Fitzharding ·, and, as a Roman Catholic, following the fortunes of King
Jaines, he was succeeded in command of that regiment, December 3lst, by the Viscount, its
former Colonel. Maxwell rejoined King James in Ireland in 1689; was made Colone] of the
Regiment of Irish Dragoons, to which Daniel Macgennis was Lieutenant Colonel, and
Callaghane Major3 and, in the course of the war there against the Prinee of Orange, during
that and the two ensuing years, became Brigadier and Major-General in the Irish Army.
The confidence placed by the Duke of Berwick in Maxwell, when sent with the representatives
of the discontented party in the Irish Army, δῖα, into France, has been already seen. After
his capture at Athlone, he mentions, in a letter of thanks to George Clarke, the Irish Wil-
liamite Secretary at war, that he met with the best treatment as a prisoner, both at Dublin
Castle and Chester Castle. He afterwards passed over to France, to rejoin King James's
Army there, and as Brigadier of Dragoons, at the head of two Regiments of Irish Dragoons
