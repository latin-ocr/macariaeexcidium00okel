wise been mentioned in Note 883 an inattention further alluded to, from past experience,
as well as recent informatiom by the King's Envoy at Rome, Lord Melfort, when writ-
ing to the Queen, May Qud, 1690, he says: ‘⁶ There is not one thingl stand so much in
fear of, as negligence in executing the King's orders.'‘ It also appears, that, so far from
merely occupying himself in disbanding his new-raised levies, the King, by the Duke of
Tyrconnell's advice, was desirous of employiug all the men he could. “ The Duke of Tyr-
connell‚” says the Jacobitejournal, “at his return from visiting the troops, acquainted his
Majesty, that he found amongst the infantry so many good men, that he could not think of
disbanding them3 and, therefore, that he had kept up, in some regiments‚ ‘20 eompanies, in-
stead of 13³; and in others, 22 companies, &C.'' At the same time, the smallness of the
means which the King possessed sor organizing any thing like a numerous and efficient
military force, as contrasted with a rabble of unequipped and untrained men, appears
in Note 94, from his informing us, that the three regiments of foot, two regiments of dra-
goons, and some horse, or only &600 men, whom he had sent, under Lord Mountcashel,
against Enniskillen‚ were ‘¹ ALL the troops the King could draw togacher a! that time, haveing,''
it is added, ‘⁵ with himself at Dublin hut one Battalion of Guards, Grace's regiinent of foot,
and not aboue two troops of hors and Drngoons, besides his troop of Guards which was then
but begining to be mounted.'' This was owing, amongst other causes, to the nig‘gardliness
and delay observed in the assistance afforded to the King by the French Ministry; whereas,
acting in a different manner, says the King, alluding to the Prinoe of Orange, ‘⁶ might haue
cost him his usurped crown itself, if the Councells of France thorough too much diffidence,
private piques, and personal animositys, had not fail'd in sending such succors thither,'' that
is, to lreland, ‘¹ asboth reason, honour, or their own intrest, so manifestly call'd for.’' Hence,
the weakness and inadequacy of means for a siege, on the part of the King's force before
Derry, were such, that their best hope of taking it was connected with what hunger and dis-
ease might effect within the town, rather thau with any thing that could be efl'ected against it
from without* Several days before Derry was relieved, through the entrance of ships with
provisions detached from the English fleet. by Major-General Kirke, at “a Council of War‚''
in the King's force before the town, the Jacobite journal informs us, that “the opinions of
all theGeneral Officers did unanimously conclude, that it was impossible to take the town, but by
famine: which opinions were signed by the respective Officers and sent to the King3 upon

ἱ For tho correct reading of thirteen, above in-
serted, as that of the general number ofcompanics
in each of King Janies's soot regiments, thirty is
found, by a strange over-sight, in both editions of
the Jacobite jonrnal. In the previous part of that
journal, the royal regulation for the number of
infantry regiments to be maintained, and for the
couipanies which each regiment, except the Guards,
was to contain, is given as ‘⁸ thirty-five Regiments

of Foot, of which the Regiment of Guards had two
battalions, and the rest THIRTm-:N campanies euch.
every company of sixty-two men.'' WVcre the
Duke of Tyrconnell to have advocatcd tho keeping
up of twenty or twenty-two companies in a regi-
ment instead of thirty, he wouldhavc bccn sor less-
ening, instead of increasing, the number of ‘⁶ good
men'' in the King's service; so that thirty must be
a mistake for thirteen.
