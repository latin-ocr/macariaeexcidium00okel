xii stlemoir of Colonel Clzarles O’Kelly.

civil war breaking out in Ireland in the autumn of 1641, he was summoned
home to join the royal cause3 on which side, his father acquired the rank of
Colonel; distinguished himself by his services during the contest, under the
Marquisses ofOrmonde and Clanricarde3 and suffered, in consequence, under
the revolutionary interregnum, or usurpation, till the Restoration; when he was
specially decreed, under the Act of Settlement, all the estate to which he was
entitlcd, either by possession or reversim, before the eommencement of the dis-
turbances 111 1641. Young Charles, after returning to Ireland in 1642, obtained
the command of a troop of horse under the Marquis of Ormonde3 and signalized
himself in the royal army 011 various occasions, while the war lasted there. On
the ultimate success of the Parliamentarians‚ or Cromwellians, he retired with a
body of 2000 of his countrymen into thc Spanish dominions, to serve Charles IL,
as he had previously served his father. Thence, on hearing that the King was
111 France, he repaired‚ with most of the Officers and soldiers belonging to that
corps, who were formed into a regimem, which he was appointed to command.
Upon the conclusion, between Cardinal Mazarin and Oliver Cromwell, of the
treaty of alliance against Spain, in consequence of which the banished royal
family of England were obliged to quit France, Colonel Charles O'Kelly, with
other gallant and loyal exiles. transferred his services to the crown of Spain, as
that power in whose territory their Sovereign had to seek protection. There
the Colone] remained till the reinstatcment of the monarchy in Great Britain
and Ireland in 1660; when, says my authority, ‘⁶ he came into Eusslaml, and
was always highly esteemed for his Learning, Loyalty, and great Services, both
at home and abroad.” By the decease of his father, Colonel John O'Kelly, in
1674, he succeeded to the family estate (so fortunatcly saved from the general
landed spoliation of the older Irish proprietors under the Act of Settlelnent),
and became ninth lord of the manor of Screen.

In the reign of King James IL, when the ancient gentry of the country, of
Milesian, and Anglo-Norman, or old English origin, as opposed to the ‘¹ settlers''
of the recent revolutionary or Cromwellian ‘⁴ plantation‚'' were the general ob-
jects of royal favour and promotion, we find the Colonel's brother, John of
Clonlyon, mentioned as High Sheriff of the County of Roscommon in 1686.
The Colonel himself appears as one of the twenty—four Burgesses of the reformed
orremodelled Corporation of Athlone in November, 1687, as his brother, John,
likewise seems to have been, under the enrohnent of “ John Oye O'Kelly,” or
