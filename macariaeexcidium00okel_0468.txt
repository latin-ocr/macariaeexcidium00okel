4 36 Notes and Illzcstratz'ons.

nents, or General Ginkell‘s army, at ‘25‚000 men. ‘⁴ At the battle of Aughrim‚’' says the Li.
merick writer, in the first edition of his work, printed in 1772, “ 15,000 Irish, ill paid and
worse eloathed‚ fought with 25‚000 men highly appointed, and the flower of all Europe;
composed of English, Dutch, Flemings, and Danes, vying with each other.”

As to Story's assertion, making the Irish Officers confess their army to have been nigh
*25‚()00 in number, or about 8000 more than the English, who, according to him, ‘¹ could
nat make up 17,000 Horse and Foot‚'' it would have been more satisfactory, had he told us
who were the Irish Officers, that made any such ‘⁴ confession.'' At all events, we know. of
Major-General William Dorrington, Colonel of King James's Regiment of Irish Foot
Guards,—who, from his high station in the army to which he belonged, may be supposed to
have had (lue means for learning its numerical strength, and who subsequently, or after his
having been made prisoner at Aughrim, would have opportunities of inquiring amongst the
Williamite officers, respecting the number oftlaeir army at the battle,—we know of that Jaco-
bite General Officer, from what he is alleged by Williamite authority to have said upon
the subject, that his “ confessi0n” was the very reverse of what Story would attribute to the
lrish officers. In a letter to George Clarke, Genera] Ginkell’s Secretary, at his camp,
written from Dublin Casae, July 18111, 1601, or six days after the battle, by Israel Fielding‚
acting Secretary to the Williamite Lords Justices for Ireland, the Williamite functionary
says: ‘⁴ Dorrinton tells me our Army outnumbered elzeirs'’¹¹. And King James's Memoirs‚
though not giving any exact statement as to the comparative numbers of each army, yet, in
mentioning the force opposed to St. Ruth in the battle, as “the enemie, who outnwuher‘d
him,” would tend to show, along with what Colone] O'Kelly represents the Irish officers as
setting forth in their Council of War to the same effect, that a very different iinpression
existed among-st the officers of King James‘s army, from that of their forces having been
more numerous than those of General Ginkell.

Of the British and Anglo-Irish regiments and Huguenot regiments, in William lllxs pay,
who served at the battle of Aughrim, the writer of this note has collected the complements,
when perfect, in men and officere, from a great mass of official and original documents in Tri-
nity College Library, Dublin, and the State Paper Office, aud British Museum, London.
Ofthe other, or foreign regiments, in William‘s pay, who likewise took part in that engage-
ment, the writer has been able to collect, from the same sources, the complements, when
perfect, ofthe soldiers only. Of the reformed offioers, gentlemen supernumeraries, or volun-
teers, attached, during the Irish war, to any of the foregoing Williamite regiments‚ except
to the three French infantry, one French cavalry regimem, and one Anglo-Irish, or Colonel
John Michelburne's regiment, the writer has not found any regular account, and so far makes

no allowance for such officers‚ although their entire number must have been pretty conside-
rable.

‘⁴ Major-Genera] Dorrington, it may be also ob· Irish army were less in number than their oppo-
served, could have no motive, connected with na· nents, since he was not a native of Ireland, but of
tional vanity, to induce him to assert, that the England.
