pour lors a Londres.” Soon after, he himself effected his escape from his Dutch guards, at
Rochester, by night, and sailed for France in a little vessel, accompanied by his son, the Duke
of Berwick, two sea officers, Captains Trevanion and Maedonnell (most probably Captain Ran-
dall Macdonnell, an Irishman), Mr. Biddulph, a Gentlemen of the Bedchaxnber, and Labadye,
one of the royal valets. “ Resides the danger ofer-ossing the seas in so small a vessel, and in
the depth of winter,'’ observe the royal Memoirs, “he was pen'd up all that while. in a small
cabbin where was just room sor him and the Duke of Berwick to sit, in continual aprehen-
tions of being attached and seized again by his rebellious subject& however it was some
cause of mirth to him, when growing very hungry and dry, Captain Travanian went to fry
his Majesty some bacon, but bymisfortune the frying pan haveing a hole in it, he was forced to

For Louis XIV.'s having either taken an oath under circumstances of such remarkable
solemnity as those above stated, or any oatlz at all, with respect to the restoration of James ΙΙ.
to his throne, the writer of this note has not found any authority in French histories or me-
