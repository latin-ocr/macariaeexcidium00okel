towards Slane, against Lieutenant Gener-al Douglas and count Schonberg, lest, to use the
words of James himself, respecting the enemy, ⁶· they might have got to Dnlick before the
King, who was with the left, and so have cut off* his retreat to Dublin and routezl tlze whole
rzrmy.‘’ Having mentioned the passage of the river towards Slane by the enemy's right wing—
after an opposition from ‘¹ S·· Neale O'Neal's dragoons‚'' who ⁴· did their part very well and
disputed the passage with the enemie almost an hour till their Cannon came up, and then
retired in good order with the loss only of flue or six common men, their Colonel shot
through the thigh and an officer or two wounded,''—his Majesty gives the following account
of what happened on his lest, where he and Lauzun were, “ Nn sooner‚'' observe the royal
Memoirs, “ had the Enemie passed there, but they stretched out their line to the right as if
they desired to take us in the flank, or get between us mul Dublin, which Mons‘ de Lausune
seeing marched with the left to keep up with them, and obserue their 1notion; while this was a
doing the King went to the right to hasten up the troops to follow Lausune, believeing the main
body of the Enemie's Army was following their right which had passed at Slanet . . . . The
King took the reserue consisting of Purcel's hors and Brown's foot, with which he marched
till he came up to tha rear of the foot that follow'd Lausune, and there ordei-ing S‘ Charles
Carny, who commanded the reserue, to post himself at the right of the first line of those
foot to make a sort of left wing there. and then rid along the line where he found Lausune
and the Enemie's Right drawn up in battle, within half cannon shot, faceing each other: the
King did not think fit to charge just then, being in expectation of the troops he had lest at
old bridg, but while he was discoursing this matter with Lausune, an Aid de Camp came to
gine the King an account that the Enemie had forced the pass at old bridg, and that the
right wing was beaten; which the King wispering in Lausun's ear, tould him, There was now
nothing to be done but to charge the Enemie forthwith‚ before his troops knew what had
happen'd on the right, and by that means try, if they could recover the day3 and accord-
ingly sent Mons'' Hoguette to the head of the French foot, made all the Dragoons to light,
and placed them in the intervalls between the hors, and order’d Lausune to lead on: but
just as they were beginning to moue, Sarsfield and Maxwell who had been to view the ground
betwixt the two Armys, said It was· impossible for tlte hors lo cltarg llze enemie hy reason of

on his march, but the right wing's being beat was no longer a mistery, for several of the
scatter'd and wounded hors men got in amongst them before they rought (reached) Du-
