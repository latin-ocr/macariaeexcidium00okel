prevail‘d with the Captain to get under sail, and fall down with the tyde to Duncannon, and
came to the King there about noon to acquaint him with what they had done, adviseing him
it would be easier to go on board her, and so pass by sea to Kingsale, rather then by Water-
ford, the wind being good and the coast cleere, and that if his Majesty could get out that
evening he might be at Kingsale next morning early; the King liked the proposition, and went
on board assoon as the ship fell down, and got over the bar before night, as soon as he was
at Sea, those gentlemen would have perswaded the King to haue gon to rights for Brest, but
the King did not think fit to do that, so he got early next morning to Ki1igsale’'³, ἃς.

of Seven small freneh ships, with some merchant men laden with corn and wine, togather with
Mons‘ Du Quesne who had three small frigats likewise.'' It is added, that ⁴⁶ the Queen had
obtain'd these ships for the King's service in Ireland, which sell out opertunely enough sor

whence he sent an express to the Queen to acquaint her with his arrival there, and his misfor-
tune in the Country from whence he came''1.

make tlte best conditions they could, fin* themselves.

The King does not appear, from the Seram-t authorities, to have given any such orders as
these, ere his departure from Dublin. The commands which he did give to Colonel Simon
Luttrell respecting all the soldiery in town, except two troops of the Royal Regiment of
Horse, have been previously mentioned, in Note 133. The Duke of Berwick says, in relating
the retreat from the Boyne ι ‘⁴ La nuit venue, nous reqsunes ordre de marcher εὶ Βυ111111; ce

turn to Dublin from the Boyne, the Duke remarks, that the Κίος considered, ‘¹ qu'il conve-
