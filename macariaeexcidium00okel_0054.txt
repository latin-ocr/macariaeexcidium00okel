Excidium fllacarz‘ce ,· or,

Supremacy, who was not of Galaminian blood. As population increased,
however, this sovereign Supremacy caused much domestic stn'fe and in-
testine war, through the struggles of so many Princes, each canvassing
and ardently seeking, by every means, to wield its power. And though,
by these divisions, the public peace was often disturbed, and the nation
lacerated to its very vitals, yet from this very evil arose the good, that
so thoroughly were the inhabitants trained to war, and exercised in
arms, that it was universally admitted they were the most martial nation
on the earth, whom even that power destined to bc the vietors of both
earth and sea dared neither to iri-itate, norinjure. Nor, in the days ofyore‚
as now-a-days, was war urged to the extermination or expatriation of
either party; the event of a single battle generally terlninated the con-
test; each injured Chieftain challenged the invader of his rights, and he
must either submit, or bide the issue of the sword; and thus victory
decided the controversy3 and, once decided, all returned to their homes,
untill some fresh disagr’eement called them forth again. Nor was this
a matter of any great difficulty, when all were thus perpetually armed,
and ready for the conflict.

observabant: nec ulli, nisi Galamz'noe stirpis, 111 hunc majestatis apicem adscis-
cebantur. Imperium vero sobolescentibus Incolis, tot principum ambitu, domi-
nationem per fas et nefas appetentium, subinde distractum convulsumque,
domesticis atque intestinis seditionibus causam frequenter praebuit: ac quan-
quam non raro hisce dissidentium factionibus, pace rupta, ipsa regni viscera
dilacerarentur, ex hoc tamen malorum sonte id emolumenti profluebat, ut
Incolae continua armorum tractatione ita exerciti paratique essent, ut gens
orbis bellicosissima, publico mortalium consensu censeretu13 quamque, qui
maria terrasque victoriis permensi erant, irritare ac lacessere non auderent.
Nec olim usque ad exitium partium et internecionem, ut hisce temporibus
factitatum videmus, certabatur: rixam unius praelii eventus ut plurimum
terminabat3 qui injuriam sibi illatam conquerebatur, aliena jura invaden-
tem bello provocabat: illi autem aut possessione cedendum erat, aut ferro
decernendum et ita victoria discordiae modum faciebat. Unde, rebus ea
ratione compositis, domum mox discedebatur, donec novis rursum occasioni-
bus excitarentur, quod factu promptum erat, cum unicuique equi et arma ad
manum essent.
