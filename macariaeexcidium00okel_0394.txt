described, in Grammont's Memoirs, as eminently beautiful in person, and agreeable in conver-
sation. She was first married in 1665 to Sir George, otherwise Count Hamilton, (grandson
of James, first Earl of Abercorn,) “a younger brother, and without fortune.” He rose to be
a Marechal de Camp 111 1119 French service, and died leaving her the mother of three daugh-
ters, Elizabeth, Frances, and Mary, afterwards married to the Viscounts Ross, Dillon, and
Kingsland. She became the wife of her former admirer, Colone] Richard Talbot, at Paris,
in 1679. By the Colonel, subsequently Duke of TyrconneH, she had two daughters; one of
whom, Lady Charlotte Talbot, became Princess de Vintimiglia; and the other seems to have
died young, as neither her name, nor any further particulars respecting her, are known.

After the Duke of Tyrconnell's death, 111 1691, the Duchess and her daughters lived
abroad, on a small pension from the Court of Franee. Having, subsequent to 1708, been
restored a portion of the Duke's property, she returned to the Irish metropolis. She ap-
pears to have devoted the rest of her life to relig-lom founded a nunnery in King-street;
and died in Dublin, March 12th‚ 1731, 111 11 very advaneed age. “Her death,’' says Wal-
pole, “ was occasioned by her falling out of her bed on the floor‚ in a winter's night3 and
being too feeble 10 rise or to call, was found in the morning so perished with cold, that she
died in a few hours.’' She is mentioned to have been described, by those who saw her in her
old age, as “ low in stature, and extremely emaciated; without the least trace of having ever
been a beauty.''

Lord Melfort speaks. in no measured terms, of the Duchess of Tyrconnell, in his correspon—
(lence ; both as regards her general character, and her conduct, in the above-mentioned removal
of the treasure from Ireland. Writing‚ in October, 1689, from Paris, to King James, in Ire-
land, his Lordship says: “ There is one othcr thing,ifit could be effectuate, were ofintinite use;
which is the getting the duchess of Tyrconnel‚ for her health‚ to come into France. Idid not
know she had been so well known here as she is; but the terms they give her, and which, for
your service, I may repeat unto yon, is, that she has (came Ζα plus noire (sni se puisse conce-
voir). 1 think it would help to keep that peace, so necessary for you, and prevent that caball-
ing humour, which has very ill effects.'‘ Writing from Rome to Father Maxwell, in October,
in 1690, 1115 Lordship observes: ⁰ I think his (Tyrconnell’s) Dutehess robbing in a manner
Irlande of so much mony, ἃ pretending it was the King'S‚ should be no great commendation.
But she is of the number of the fortunat may doe what they please, 8: shall be better looked
on than others, whatever their services are.'' However, a very considerable allowanee should
be made in those statements of 1115 Lordship, for the hostility existing· between him, and the

Duke and Duchess of Tyrconnellv.
