Boyne, gives us 483 reformed officers‘. Neither has the writer found the morning states
of General Ginkell's army for the day of the battle of Aug-brim, which would show the exact
number of men and officers on the field, or absent. But, giving the foreign regiments, above
referred to, the same arithmeticalproptu-tion of officers, to the number of their soldiers, as the
British regiments had, and supposing all the regimentS, British and foreign, at Aughrim,
to have had their perfect complements of officers and soldiers, according to saell evidence,
those regiments ofinfantry, horse, and dragoonS, were by NATION, and would be by NUMBER,
