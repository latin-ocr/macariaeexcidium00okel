Thus, these tributes to the Irish Chieftains, which, in the reign of Henry Vi„ were but
„2300 perannum, besides the eighty marks a year from the Anglo-Irish Exchequer to Mac Mo-
rough, had increased in 1515, or under Henry VIII.⁷ to considerably above twice as much,
or ,36740 a year of the money ofthat age, besides the same pension to Mac Morough! Such exac-
tions would appear to have been generally continued until the year 1536, when Cox mentions
the Anglo-Irish or Pale Parliament‚ as passing “ An Act to suppress all Tributes‚ Pensions,
and Irish Exactions‚ claimed by the Irish, from Towns or Persons, for Protection.'' Even
still later, or until 1543, tributes of this kind seem to have been paid in some districts. For,

and, at the period of the Parliarnentarian or Croni-
wellian contest, appear as one of the most wealthy,
powerful, loyal, and gauant races in Munster. The
head of the name, Donat or Donough O' Callaghan,
who was possessed of large estates and several cas-
tles, was distinguished as a member of the Sove-
reign Conncil of Kilkenny, and in other posts of
the civil magistracy, amongst his countrymen ;
while, in the national army, of which his brother,
Colonel Callaghan O'Callaghan, was a brave and
skilful officer, there were, according to Dr. Cal-
1aghan, above 500 of the name, of the rank of gen-
tlemen. The Doctor’s words, writing in France,
in December, 1652, are: ‘⁶ De 13 seule branche des
