the Canopie of Heaven; and in such a miserable Condition, that it moved
Pitty in some of their Enemyes. The lamentable Cryes of this poor
forlorn Troup, (when the Flect that carryed away their F athers and
Husbancls was under Sail and gon out of Sight) would begett Compas-

Some of them had the whole Lcngth of Cyprus to traversa before they
