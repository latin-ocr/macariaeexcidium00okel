the wars of the Danes in Ireland, discovered in the library of Trinity College
and in the Royal Library at Brussels. This work would be fin· too expensive
for the Society to undertake in the present state of its funds 3 but the Council
would earnestly recommend it to their successors as one of the most important
original authorities on Irish history that has recently been rescued from obli-
vion. Its publication would bea boon to the literature of Europe ; soritis well
known that great obscurity still hangs over the history of the maritime expedi-
tions of the ancient Norsemcn ; and a local narrative ofundoubted antiquity, as
this euricus work most certainly is, would be hailed with gratitude by all those
nations who are interested in the history of that extraordinary people. In
1770 the Lcyden Academy offered a prize (for which thero was no competitor)
for the best account os the invasion of the Low Countries, and the settlement
of the Norsemen there ; and similar questions have been proposed fer compe-
tition by the Academy of History and Antiquities of Stockholm, in 18003 by
the University of Abo, in F inland, in 1818, for an account of the expeditions of
the Norscmen into Russia; and by the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and
Belles Lettres of Paris, in 1820, for an account of the remarkable expedition
which gave name to Normandy in Franee((1).

‘⁶ It would, therefore, be an indelible disgrace to Ireland', possessing, as we
do, an ancient and authentie narrative of the Norse wars in this country, such
as no other European nation, where the Nor-semen settled, has as yet pro-
duced, if it should turn out that wc are unable, not so much from poverty, as
from indifference to the subject, to make known that literary treasure to the
world. It can scarcely be doubted that were this object sufficiently under—
stood, the publication of the work alluded to could not be delayed for want of
funds. The Council have, therefore, had it in contemplation to bring the sub—
ject not only before the Members of this Society, but also before the public
generally, with a view to ascertain how far the projected publication may be
expected to obtain support 3 but as these measures are not yet fully matured,
they must, for the present, be dismissed with this brief allusion to them.

was awarded by the Academie des Inscriptions in 1822 ; it is entitled, ‘⁴ Histoire des Expeditious maritimes

work was printed iu Paris in 1845.
