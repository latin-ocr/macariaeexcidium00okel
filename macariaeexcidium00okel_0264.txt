the Scots of Ireland were no less active than their brethren of Albany; and it is, therefore,
remarkable that the Roman commander, though fitting out a fleet to chastise the Saxons in
the Orcades, should yet have left Ireland, whose currachs wafted over such hostile swarms to
his shores, still exempt from invasion. That his fleet chased, however, some of her vessels into
their own northern harbours, may be concluded from a passage of the poem of Claudian,

which commemorates this war:
‘¹ “ Nec falso nomine Pictos

Edomuit, Scotumque vago mucrone ser-utus,
Fregit Hyperboreas remis audacibus undas*

‘⁴ The few following lines from the same poem describe briefly and pieturesquely the signal
triumph over the three hostile nations, which Theodosius had aehieved :
‘⁸ ¹ Maduerunt Saxone fuso

Orcades, incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule,
Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Ierne.‘

‘⁴ An invasion of Britain, on a far more extensive scale than had yet been attempted from
Ireland‚ took place towards the close of the fourth century (A. D. 3964), under the auspices
of Nial of the Nine Hostages, one of the most gallant ofall the princes ofthe Milesian race.
Observing that the Romans, after breaking up their lines of encampment along the coast op-
posite to [1·elan‹l, had retired to the eastern shore and the northern wall, Nial perceived, that
an apt opportunity was thus offered for a descent upon the now unproteeted territory.
Instantly summoning, therefore, all the forces of the island, ancl embarlxing them on board
such ships as he could collect, he ranged with his numerous navy along the whole coast of
Lancashire, effecting a landing in Wales, from whence he carried offimmense plunder, and,
though compelled ultimately to retreat, left marks of (lepredation and ruin wherever he passed.
It was against this adventurous monarch. that some of those successes were aohieved by the
Romans, which threw such lustre arouud the military administration of Stilicho, and inspired
the muse of Claudian in his praise. ‘By him,‘ says the poet, speaking in the person of
Britannia, ‘was Iprotected, when the Scot moved all Ireland against me, and the ocean
foamed with his hostile oars.’

‘¹ The tottering state of the Roman dominion in Gaul, as wellas in every other qnarter, at
this period, encouraged the Hero of the Nine Hos-tages to extend his enterprizes to the coast
of Britany3 where, after ravaging all the maritime districts of the north-west of Gaul, he was
at length assassinated, with a poisoned arrow, by one of his own followers, near the Portus
Iccius, not far, it is supposed, from the site of the present Boulogue.
