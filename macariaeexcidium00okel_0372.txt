340 Notes and I llustrations.

Dublin receiv'd the certain Account of King William's Landing'' and when King James quitted
it to go and meet him, says: ‘⁶ It was expected the Irislz would have been much cast down
upon King ιῙιίηιεςέ leaving Dnblz'n, and the certain News os King William‘s Landing, but they
were much the contrary, they triumphed and rejoyeed as if they had got King william in a
Pound, and the Day were their own. They were assured either that the French Fleet would
cut off King William from England, or that an Insurrection would be made there'’¹¹.

Formidahle superiority, on William's jzcnctz'on with Sclwnbmg, of their army, as composed not

Swedes, Get-mans, §¹0-

Amongst the nations of Europe specified by Colonel O'Kelly as oomposing the army pre-
pared by William ΙΙΙ. for the reduction of Ireland, the Swedes are to be understood asin-
cluded in the Dutch forces; william, in his capacity of Stadtholder of Holland and King of
England, having composed, in 1689, a dispute between the Danes and Swedes, so as to obtain,
for his Dutch and English objects, troops from both those northern Kingdoms, that. had they
gone to war, should have been employed against each other. ¹‘ This he effectually did,¹’ says our
elever countryman, Lord Molesworth, in his Account of Denmarlz, where he was Embassad0r;
‘⁴ for the Dones immediately afterwards sent by Treaty [000 Soldiers, which are yet (1692) in
his Majesty's Pay; and the Sit-edes remain at Liberty to continue such of their Troops in the
Dutch Sel-vice as formerly were stipulated for. and which (had a War broken out), they might
have been forced to recall.'’ From Marshal Schonberg's correspondence with William, we
likewise Iearn, that his French Protestant regiments were recruited, for the Campaign 0f1690.
in Switzerland3 and Norway being then a portion of the Danish monarchy, it is not unnatural to
suppose, that, amongst the 7000 auxiliaries obtained from the Danish King by william, there
would be Norwegians serving as well as Danes. The Williamite army would thus consist
of the troops of ΤΕΝ different European nations,—l‚ English3 2, Scotch; 3, Anglo·lrish;

4, Dutch; 5, Swedes; 6, Brandenburgers or Germans; 7, Danes3 8, Norwegians ; 9, French;
10, Swiss.

In reference to the large amount of foreigners, as well as native British troops, in Wil-
liam‘s army, Dalrymple says of William, that, ‘⁶ distrusting English soldiers to fight against
one who had been lately King of England, he took care that one half of his army should con-
sist of foreigners.'' And this assertion of Dalrymple respecting William would seem to be con-
firmed by that Prince's employing‚ at the Boyne, his English forces as little as possible, and
laying the stress of the engagement on his Continental and Anglo-Irish troops. “As to our
English Forces,'’ says Story, “ there were few of them that had an Opportunity at this Plaee
to shew themselves, but those that had, aequitted themselves very well3 the Frenclt and [nnis-
