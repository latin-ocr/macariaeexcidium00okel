“ Ι. Primo statutum est, quod universi fideles per Hiberniam constituti, repudiato cogna-
torum et affinium contubernio, legitima contrahant matrimonia et observent.
“ 11. Quod infantes ante fores ecclesiae catechizentur, et in sacro fonte in ipsis baptisma-

libus ecclesiis baptizentur.

a single Irish layman was present with the clergy at
this memorable assembly ! How, to Lanstanc,
Archhishop ot' Canterbury, in 1074, and to Pope
Innocent 11., in 1139, it seemed most suitable t'or
such assemhlies to be formed in Ireland, according
to the intelligent-e those eminent churchmen had re-
ceived ot'the stateofthe country, appears from what
the former wrote to King Turlongh O'Brien, and
from what the latter said to St. Malae-hy O‘Morgair
at Rome. The Archbishop of Canterhury thus ex—
presses himself to valough, in reference to the
holding of a Council 111 Irelaml for the abolition os
certain abuses :-⁴· Episeopos et religiosos quosque
viros in unum convenire jubete,'‘ and “sacru eo-
rum conventui, presentiam vestram, enm vestris
optimatibus, exliil›ete.'' The Pope observed to
St. Malachy, with regard to Irelaml, for which the
Irish Saint had asked palliulns,—“ Convocatis epis-
copis et clericis. et majoribus terrie, cclelirabisyeue-
rale concilium : et sic conniventia, et communi roto
universorum, pei· honestas personas requiretis pal-
lium, et dabittu· vobis.·' That Lanfranc and Inno-
cent, in recommendingthe presence of laymen with
churchmen at those assemblies, did what was con-
sistent with the national usage, in this respect, on
important occasions, would appear, from what Dr.
Lanigan relates, of there having been such mixed
attendances, at the most eelebrated of our Synods,
111 the twelfth century, previous to this of Cashel.
According to the Doctor, at the great Synod of
Fiadh-mao-AEngussa, in 1111, there attended, in
addition to the Archbishops of Armagh and Cashel,
50 bishops, 300 priests, and 3000 persons of the
clerical order, ‘⁴ Min-zoyli O'Brien, Kiny nfLetlz-
muylm (or the southern half of helam), and tlte
nobles ofltis kinydmn.'' At the Synod of Rath-
Breasail, about the year 1115, presidet] over by
Giuebert‚ Bishop of Limerick, and Papal Legate,

111st ARCH. SOC-

“IV. In

(as Christian, Bishop of Lismore. was afterwards
in Ireland.) the assembly, says the Doctor, ‘⁶ was
attended, like that of Fiadh-mac-AEngussa, not only
by bishops and clergynien of various ranks„ but like-
wise by (listinynished Iuymenfrom, it seems, ‹tllpurts
oflrelarztl.'’ At the Synod of Kells. held in 1152,
under the Papal Legata Cardinal John Papnro,
where Christian, Bishop ot* Lismore, sat likewise
as a Papal Legate, and where, besides Archbishops
and Bishops‚ Abbots and Priors, there were 3000
clergymen, we find, amongst those who were there.
observes the Doctor, ⁴* kiuys, dulces. audather dis-
tinynislzed laymen.'' At the Synoil of Mefflfont,
in 1157, ⁴‘ attended by the Primate Celusius. Chris-
tian, Bishop of Lismore and Apostolie Legate, 17
other Bishops, and innumerable olel-gymen, of infe-
rior ranks‚ there were present also‚‘' adds the
Ductor, ‘⁸ Murclzertayh or lllztrtouyli O'Lvylelin,

to the Iaity as well as the cleryy of Ireland was
this Synod of Cashel‚ than any of those other
Synods! — (Ussher, Epistolarum Hibernicarum
