On this occasion, the French funeral oration of the Duke of Tyrconnell, already cited,
says of the Duke’s father, Sir William, that ‘¹ sa sagesse intrepide le rendit si formidable aux
Ministres‚ que leur politique cruelle lui attira une prison de plusieurs annees ; par cette seul
raison, disoientdls, qu'il ne leur seroit jamais possible de sofimettre l’lrlande‚ tant qu'elle au-
roit un tel defenseur.” He was, as stated in the Desiderata Curiosa Hiberniae, “ a long time
imprisoned in the Tower, and fined TEN THOUSAND POUNDs‚‘’-an enm-mous sum for that pe-
riod ! He left his estates, on his death, to his eldest son, Sir Robert Talbot3 who took a dis-
tinguished part, on the side of the Irish Confederates, or royalists, against the Parliainentarian
and Cromwellian republican& or revolztcionists⁰; and is charaeterized by Carte, as ‘⁴ a Gentleman

of very good sense, strict honour, and great bravery,'¹ &e

charles Ι. and Abbe Mac Geoghegan connected
with the application of the term ⁴⁵ rebels-‘¹ to the
Irish, by British republican or revolutionary wri-
ters, or their copyists. An amusing instance of the
correctness, per antiphrasin, of this appellation to
the Irish, in the time of Chai-les L, is given hy
Ludlow, who first fought for the Parliament against
the King in England⁷ and next commanded for the
Parliament 111 Ireland against the Irish, then tight-
ing under King Charles 1135 commission, after the
sale and execution of his father, King Charles 1.‚
in Great Britain.

Church. till the pleasuse of the King might be

very zealous to justify the King's cause, and to con-
demn that of the Parliament. These men were Irish
Papists, sent over by the rebels in Ireland, to trent
with the King ou their part, about assisting him
against the Parliament. This I afterwards under-
stood from one of them, whose name was Cauaghan
OCallaghan, when together with the brigade com-
manded by the Lord Musquerry, he laid down his
arms to me iu Ireland. The King, looking upon
such men as most to be confided in, gives the Pre-
sidentship of Murem, vacant by the death of Sir
William St. Ledger‚ to the Lord Musquerry, an
Irish rebel:¹' &ed

liamentarians under Ludlow, until leave was ob-
tained from Charles ΙΙ. to malie ternis with those
Parliamentarians whom His Majesty counted ‘⁵ re—

family, with a considerable Irish emigrant force,
were aportion ofthose of their nation who followed
Chai-les ΙΙ. in his exile to the Continent, acting
there as he directed, and even eontributing for his

Cromwelliauism in Great Britain and Irelancl, his
