he knew little of Religion, so he regarded it less. But,'’ adds the Bishop respecting the Duke,
“he answered the King, that, tho' he had little Conscience, yet he was of a Party that had
Conscience.''

against the Irish, assigned to him by Colonel O’Kelly, was probably the attempt upon his
Grace's life in London, during the beat of the Revolufion, or in December, 1688, on his
advanee, by the Prince of Orange's orders. to take possession of Tilbury Fort, where a party
of Irish, belonging to King James's army, had been stationed. ‘¹ As the Duke‚'' says Harris.
‘¹ was marching through the Strand at the head of his regiment, an Irish trooper, galloping
down Catherine-street, took aim at his Gracc with his carbine t One of the Duke's grenadiers
was quicker than the trooper, and shot him immediately from his horse, nor did he live long
enough, to confess the reason of so desperate an attempt’'⁰.
