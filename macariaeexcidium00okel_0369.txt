ally representing to the King. ..... But all their arguments and aprehentions could not
prevail upon his Majesty to take any such mensures, he was resolved not to be tamely walked
out of Ireland, but to have one blow for it at least; My Lorcl Tyrcumzel,¹’ adds the King,
“ some of the French Officers, and many of his own Subjects concured with his Majesty in this
1·esolutlon.”

This difference between the opinions of the Duke and the Marshal, as to the measures to
be adopted in reference to Sclionberg‘s invasion, is likewise mentioned, in his rambling and
irregular manner, by Story. Having stated of Marshal Schonberg's force, “ Fame had made
our Army twice as many as they were,’' that, when they ‘⁴ came first to Dnmlall‹‚” the Irish
“ were in such Disorder, that most of them retreated beyond D1·0gl1e(la‚'' and that he ‘⁶ was
told since by some of themselves, they had not at that Time above &000 in a Body,'' the Wil-
liamite Chaplain adds, ‘¹ Mareschal De Fore was very much concerned atthis, and he with some
others, were for deserting Droghesla and Dublin, and retreating towards Athlone and Lime-
rick. ..... This my Lord Tyrconnel heard of, where he was sick at Chastpell-I::m·rl, and
went immediately to Dmglzeda, where he told them, that he would have an Army there hythe
next Night of 20‚000 men, which accordingly proved true, for they came in from Munster on

all Hands.”
This conduct of the Duke of Tyrconnell, notwithstanding his delicate state of health at

the time, is likewise referred to in his funeral oration, delivered at the office celebrated for
him by order of King Janmx, and in presence of that Monarch and a distinguished congrega-
tion, at Paris, August *2:2nd, 1692. After notit-ing the Duke's illness, the oration thus pro-
ceeds: ‘¹ Telle est la sujetion attachee εὶ 1”ἐιηίηεῃορ dela Royautc, que celuy qui en est revetu
ne sqauroit tout faire par lui-meme. 11 peut bien former lui seul de salutaires conseils, mais
il a besoin que (Γ autres les executenn ἃ· il en est d'une telle importance, qu’il n'y a quelque-
fois qu'un seul homme qui soit capable de les executer. En effet, durant la longuemaladie du
Viceroy, l'armee manqua des choses niwessaires, ὣ se trouva tellement diminuee, que tous les
chefs voyant celle de l'ennemi superieure5 etoient portez a la. retraite. Mais le Roy, trans-
porte des moure-mens d‘une colere liei-dique, n'y pouvoit consentir, 8: vouloit plutost livrer un
combat avec des forces inegales ; lorsque le malade ὲ peine convalescent rassembla des troupes
disper-sees, S: en arma de nouvelles avec tant de diligence δι de succes¹ que l’ennemi qui
s'avanqoit recula, ἃ ne fit aucun progres du reste de la campagne.'' The Jacobite official
account, in speaking of the Duke of Tyrconnell's efforts to bring up the troops to offer battle
to Marshal Schonberg, says of the Duke, ‘⁴ whose Zeal and Fidelity to the Crown, in the worst

of Times, can har'dly in History find their Pa1·allel”*·.
