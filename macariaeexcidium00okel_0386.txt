went much against the grain, so the King demur'd to it, tho reitterated seueral times; but
Monsr Lausun ceased not pressing him, til at last 118 found by a more particular account

go for France and try to doe something more effeetual on that side, than he could hope from
so shatter'd and dishearten'd a body of men as now remain'd in [reland.
