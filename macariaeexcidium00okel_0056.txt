Ereidium Macarioe ,· or,

uncorruptcd saith, that their country obtained a peculiar desi gnation, and
was called the Island of Saints.

24. But never yet was kingdom placed on such a sure foundation,
that it did not ultimately arrive at the liniit of its existence; and the
Cypriam empire, which had endured more than 2000 years, at length,
yielding to the decrecs of sate, had to recognise this immutable law, to
which all human powers arc subject. Eryce& the second of the name,
King of Cilicia, had promised his assistance to illonyam's, the suppliant
Prince of Salaminia, whom the King of Qrsprzcs had exiled, for carry-
ing away the wife of another provincial Prince. The Ciliciam leaders,
whom Eryces had sent ovcr with a well-appointed fleet, to reinst-ate
flIonyanis, forcibly possessed themselves of a large portion of Salaminia,
and, having expelled the inhabitants, (livided their lands amongst the
Ciliciam adventurers. Nor do I know, that it had ever previously oc-
curred, that one nation, professing the Delplzie saith, should usurp the
dominion over another nation of the same religion, and extirpate and

mille ultra annos duraverat, ineluctabilem hanc legem, 0111 01111115 humana
potentia subjacet, fatali necessitate coactum agnovit. Erices, ejus nominis
secundus, Cilicz'oe Rex, lllonqam, Salamz'nz'oe Regulo supplici auxilia promisit,
quem Rex Cypri in exilium egerat ob raptam alterius provinciae Reguli Uxorem.
Ciliczmz Ductores, quos ad reducendum Allonssanem, instructis navibus trans-
miserat Erz'ces, magnam agrorum partem, qua patet Salaminia, vi et armis
occupavere, incolis inde abactis, arvisque Cilicas iuter colonos viritim distri-
butis. Et sane haud sciam an superioribus unquam temporibus ejusdem
inter Delphicae religionis homines usurpatum fuerit alienae ditionis accolas suis
finibus protrudere atque extirpare, quippe cum impensius vetitum sit, ac
nefas omnino habeatur, ab aliis possessa sacrilega aviditate concupiscere: ea
