Mr. Jesse, in treating of the period when William was making preparations for a landing
in England, says: ‘⁴ The manner in which, at this period,William contrived to obtain a sum cf
money from Pope Innocent XL, to assis—t him in the invasion of England, though affording suf-
ficient proof of his ingenuity, is, perhaps, not altogether to his eredit. Innocent, like William
himself, had strong reasons to be exasperated with the Freneh king, and was ready and eager
tojoin any project‚ which seemed likely to humble or embarrass that monarch. Accordingly,
:ts soon as it became known in Europe. that the Dutch were engaged in making great military
1n·e1›arations,-the object of which, however, the world was then iu ignorance of,-William
had the adroitness enough to persuade his Holiness, that, in conjunction with the Emperor, he
was about to undertake an expedition against France. Innocent fell unsuspectingly into the
snare, and, by this means, William was enabled to extract from him a considerable sum of
money, which was afterwards employed in dethroning a Roman Catholic prince, whose estab-

lishment upon the throne, it was the. primary object of the Pope to uphold‘'·¹.

“ Is the Prince of Orange, in coming to England,'' says Dalrymple‚ ¹¹ had really the inten-
tion of mounting the throne, he sleceived the Emperor as well as the Pope. In his box there
is a copy of the following letter from him to the Emperor, a short time before he sailed.''
Dalrymple then gives this important document, in the original Frenoh, and a translation into

English ; the former of which is snbjoinedw.
