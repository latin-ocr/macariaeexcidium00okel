which his Majesty, by advice of his Council, did send new orders to the Marshal De Rosen
and Hammon, commanding them to quit the siege, and only to contInue the blockade, as long
as they should think it fit for his service, or that they saw any appearance of the town‘s sur-
rendering by famine, leaving that to their prudence.''

Nevertheless, the loss occasioned in Derry through starvation, disease‚ or the sword, dur-
ing its investment by the Irish forces, or afterwards, from the effeets of that investment, was
very great. The Rev. Colonel George VValker asserts, that “ 7000 died of diseases.” The
Rev. John Maclzenzie, who was also in the town, says: ‘⁴ ’tis thought no less than 10,000
dyed during the Siege, besides those that dyed soon after.‘’ A ‘⁶ Report of a Committee of
the House of Commons'' in 1705, cited by Hamill, alleges of Derry, that “in the City, during
the Siege, to the Number of 12 000 perished by Sword and Fainine ;'' and the printed “Case
of the Governour and Garrison of Londonderry,'‘ presented to Parlianient, admits a similar
amount of destructiom specifying‚ that “ of 12,000 that dyed in that Garrison, the greatest
Part were starved.” Speaking of some “of those who‚” observes the Jacobite journal, “came
out and mixt with the people that were driven to the walls by Mons. De Rosen,'' that docu-
ment adds: ‘⁴ Several were known by their wan and lean countenances, and nauseous smeU,
that made every one think they had the plague, and others fell down dead on the strand, for
those being weak and sick people had been stau-ved in the town, where the strongest fellows
seized on the mea] and other provisions, and let the others starve.“

The following statements of the comparative strength of King James's force, and that of
their opponents, at Dei-ry, will show why, even if not ‘⁴ thinned by casualties and desertion‚’'
the royal troops would have been “quite unequal to taking so strong a city‚'* unless by famine.
The regimented men 111 Derry, by their own account, as given by the Rev. Colonel George
WValker, consisted of between 7300 and 7400 officers and soldiers, ‘⁴ Besides these Men that
were Regimented,tliere were‚'' says the Rev* John Mackenzie, “several Volunteers in Town who
did good Serviee, as Captain „Ioseph John-stou, who was very careful to have good Padrolls
kept; Captain William Crooke, and Mr. David Kennedy, and many others, who were fre-
quently out upon Service.’' The regimented and unregimented men, or the entire armed
force in the place, are estimated by the Duke of Berwick (King James's son, who was at the
siege), as “more than 10,000 well-armed1nen,” or “plus de dix mille hommes bien armes ;‘’
and still higher by a contemporary Williamite writer, who mentions “there being 12‚000 Men
in Arms in the T0w11‘·1. The artillery on the walls of Derry is stated by the Rev. Colonel
George Walker to have been twenty pieees. The Duke of Berwick says, that, in the town,
