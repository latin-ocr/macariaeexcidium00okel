from that Monarch to the Elector of Mayence; but was unfortunately lost in the
disturbances of that disastrous period. These Memoirs are stated to have em—
braced a narrative of the two wars in Ireland, in Which the author served, or the
Parliamentarian and Cromwellian war which commenced in 1641, as well as the
subsequent War of the Revolution; and, so far as can be judged from the copies,
yet preserved, of the key to the real names of the characters introduced in 1110
work, or “ Clef pour l'intelliyence des Me'moires dn Colonel Chadas O'Kelly (le

Memoirs gave a fuller description os the latter contest, than the account in 1110
Allacarioe Evcz‘dz'um. This would appear by the key containing appellations 101
several characters connected with the events leading to that contest, and for
others who took part in it; which characters are not named at all in the illaccwiw
Etvcz'clz'um. Thus, we have ‘⁴ Bellosiss' for Lord Belasys3 “ Clarindus'' sor Lord

Dr. Dominick Macguire ; “ WIicanor,⁷7 or ‘⁴ Nicanor” for Colonel Nicholas Purcelh

for the Honourable Colonel Simon Luttrell, of Luttrell's-town·¹. From this cir-
cumstance, and those previously mentioned, it would seem Colonel O’Kelly at
first only wrote the Macarim Ercidlzmz, in order that some account, though it
were but an epitome, of the war, on the Jacobite side, might remain from his
pen, ere he died: but that, when he lived longer than he had expected, he
treated the subject more fully, in the Memoirs which have unfortunately been
lost. And this last account, as the larger one, very probably contained details,
in military matters, which would tend to lessen what has been complained of
as the comparative deficiency of such, in the* Illacarioe Effl'dium.

Colonel Charles O’Kelly died at Aughrane, now Castle Kelly, in 1695, aged
about seventy-f0ur3 leaving such a character for learning, patriotism, bravery‚
loyalty, and piety, as reflects honour on his memory.
