heresiarch of this modern sect); and at length appeared in overt arms
against him.

7, These civil commotione which were carried on with various alter-
nations of success and discomfiture, at length proved fatal to Pytlzayoras:
for, when experienee had convinced him that he was no longer able to
eope with his Ciliciam and Pamplzz'lian rebels, (having estranged from
him those of his subjects on whom he might have relied), he submitted
his person and his fortunes to the keeping of these latter. Their leader
was quite a new man, with no pretensions to ancestry, and solely raised
to his position by his good fortune and his military talent; and he, it is
hard to say whether with grosser perfidy or more shameless venalsty,
betrayed the unconscious monarch, never dreaming of such a thing, or
rather basely sold him sor filthy lucre to the Ciliciam Senate, who (oh,

maximam collocaverat fiduciam. Cui vero summa inter eos armorum potestas
