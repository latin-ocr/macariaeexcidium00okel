Mcmoir qf Colonel Clzasrles O’Kelly. xv

near Loughglin, on the way to Sligo, met O'Donnell just before he coneluded
the contemplated treaty, and earnestly endeavoured to dissuade him from it.
But O'Donnell, having obtained his terms, and made his arrangementS, with
about 1200 of his troops, first joined 800 of the Williamite militia from Ulster‚
and then Lieutenant-General Arthur Forbes, Earl os Granard, With 5000 more
Williamite militia, and a train of artillery from Leinster, that were commissioned
to reduce old Sir Teague O⁷Regan in Sligo. On the march of such a large force
of the enemy towards that place, 00101101 O'Kelly had consequently to surrender
his post, about September 9th; and proceeded to Limerick, which Baron de
Ginkell was then besieging.

The 00101101 arrived there in time to give couneil, which, is acted upon,
would, to all appearances, have saved the town. The enemy's attack on the
place, only from one side of the Shannon, had availed them nothing; and, to pre-
vent any passage by 1110111 10 the opposite or Clare side, Brigadier Clifford was
duly stationed there, with a strong out-guard; while the Irish horse-camp,
under Major-General Sheldon‚ was sufficiently near to reinforce that out-guard,

in case of an alamn. Colonel O'Kelly‚ however, having 720 confidenee in Clis-
ford, 011 1110 morning of September 15th‚ warned Lord Lucan, either to assume
himself the command where Clifford was, or else to intrust that post to Major-
General Wauehop. This well-timed warning was, from some fatality in the mat-
ter, neglected3 and, accordingly, through the misconduet ofClifford apprehended
by the 00101101, 1110 enemy were not interrupted during the night 111 making
such dispositions for crossing‚ that they were over the river next morning 1
Notwithstanding the further unfortunate results of the advantage thus gained
by the enemy, the Colonel was still for holding out3 llis motto being : ‘⁶ CON-
STANCY, Νο CAPITULATION, ΑΜ) CONFIDENCE IN Gon 1 ” But, to use the words of
Count O'Kelly Far-rell: “The Almighty’s fiat had been issued; the House of
Stuart had been doomed to cease, like so many others; immoralities were to
have their chastisements, as was afterwards 1110 case with the Bourbons; and
Ireland was destined to undergo a new politica} phase, of which Providence
alone has the seeret.''

When negociations were eommeneed, it was proposed by Lord Lucan,
and the Roman Catholie Archbishop of Tuam, that 00101101 O'Kelly, then in
the horse-camp, and in whom his party reposed so much confidence, should
be sent for, and consulted about managing the treaty. But, it being objected,
