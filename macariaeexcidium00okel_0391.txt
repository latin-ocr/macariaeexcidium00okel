The state of Dublin‚ on this day, that after the battle, is thus in part described by the
Williamite author of the villare Hibernieum. “ All this Day, being Wetl71esday‚ nothing was
to be seen in Dublin, but Officers and Carriages, and the Principal Persons of the Town, their
Wives and Families going away; others coming in dusty and weary, getting away as fast as they
could. About four in the Asteruoon, the Protestants were affrighted with the Appearance ot'
the Ira-h Horse. which were drawn out of the City early in the Morning, and which they hop'd
had been quite gone, entering into the Town, followed by the Frende and Irislz Foot, in a full
Body3 but they only marched through the Town to go farther 3 the Militia that kept the City

two or three hundred of the Principal Prisoners before him ι but while they were preparing

‘⁴ A la verite‚'’ says the Duke of Berwick, of the backwardness shown in molesting James's
rear-guard, on the retreat from the Boyne‚ “ cette inaction pouvoit venir de la mort de Schom-
berg, qui avoit ete tue dans la melee du cote d'Old-Bridge. dans une des charges que nous y
fimes, ἃ l'on peut (sans faire tort au Prinne d'Orange) assui-er que Schomberg etoit meilleur
Gener-al que lui. Quoi qu‘il en soit, les ennemis nous laisserent aller tranquille1nent.'' Respect-
ing the circumstances of the veteran Marshal's death, the Duke affirms: “ Sehomberg fut tue
par un Exempt 8: quelques Gardes-du-Corps, lesquels le prirent, ἐι cause de son Cordon bleu‘J,
pour le Prince d'Orange.'' King James asserts of the Marshal, that he “ was sayd to be kill'd

Pordand, in his narrative of the engagement previously quoted, states: ¹⁶ There were 30
