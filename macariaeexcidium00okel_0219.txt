owingh, contained numbers of Dutch Roman Catholics. This appears from what occurred
between James and a body of that regiment, who were commissioned by william to attend the
King at Roobester, in December, 1688, shortly before his escape to France. Harris, in his
Life of william, after mentioning the appointment of about 100 of those Guards to wait on
James (they consisted of ‘⁸ a Captain and a hundred common men‚'' according to their royal
prisoner), thus relates the circumstance alluded to :—“ The Dutch guards left him at full
liberty. and paid him rather more respect than he had lately received from his own. Most of
that corps happened to be Papists, and when the King went to Mass, joined very reverently
with him. He asked them, How they could serve in an expedition [lengum to destruy their
own Religion? One of them answered, lent his Soztl was Gud’s, bnt liis Sword belonged tu
the Prince of Orange3 which‚·· adds Harris, ‘¹ pleased the King so much, that he repeated it
to all about him.” To the considerable proportion of Roman Catholics in those Guards, the
King’s Memoirs (though not to the extent of Harris's statement) bear testimony; by mention-
ing, that “the Officer who commanded was a Catholick, and near half the soldiers came next
morning to hear Mass with him after their arrival there.'' For the kindness shown him,
amongst these Dutch Roman Catholics os William's Guards, James, the following year, to-
wards the close of the campaign near Dundalk, against Marshal Schonberg, took an oppor-
tunity of demonstrating his gratitude. “ Three Dutch-men‚“ says the Williamite Chaplain.
Story, then with Schonberg's army, ‘⁴ were taken as they were stragling in the Country, who
being brought to King Jame-s, and askhl, who they belonged to? when he understood their
Captain was the same that had the Care of him formerly at Roclzester, he dismissed them,
with his service to their Captain, giving each of them some Mony, because, he said, their
Captain had been formerly civil to him.”

To this noble Regiment of Guards, that were commanded, at the period of William's landing
in England, by Count de Solmes, and consisted of so many as twenty-five companies, their royal
master was so warmly attached, according to Dalrymple, that the English Parliament, after
the Peace of Ryswick. or in 1699, having determined on a reduction of their army, by which
those Guards should be sent back to their own country, the King was so irritated, as to have,
for some time, thought of placing the Crown in the hands of the Parliament, and retiring to
Holland. From the considerable number of Roman Catholics, alleged to have been in those
Guards at the time of the Revolution, it is probable they were levied, to a great extent, in
North Holland3 for Mr. Hampden‚junior‚ in his speech in the English House of Commoris,
March 14, 1689, on the vote for reimbursing the Dutch for the expense of William's expedi-

tion to England. says: ‘⁴ In North Holkmd, there are more Papists than Protestants''¹.
