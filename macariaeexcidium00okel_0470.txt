ments and troops giving, ffperfect, about 2607 dragoons ; and both horse and dragoons so
forming between them about 9444 cavalry: the GRANn TOTAL of his officers and soldiers,
infantry, horse and dragoons, would, under such circumstances, be 33‚939 men—besides those
connected with the artillery.

In this summary of the number of General Ginkell's army for Aughfim, the soldiers would
be -28,008, and the officers about 5931. The military duties to be elsewhere diseharged in
the country, either in garrisons, or by detachments, were intrusted to a numerous and well
armed Anglo-Irish militia, or yeomanry, and to the fifteen remaining regiments of regular
infantry, and two regiments and two troops of regular cavalry, that, with the forty-eight
regiments and fourteen troops of Ginkell's army at Aughrim, would make up the total of Wil-
liam mss regular forces in Ireland for the year 1691, as stated by Story at sixty-seven regi-
ments of the line—exclusive of men connected with the artillery.

If to the preceding citations from the authorities of BOTH sides, it be added, that Ge-
neral Ginkell's immediate force are allowed on all hands to have been put into as complete
or efficient a condition as their Governinent could put them3 that, during the campaign,
which, commencing at Ballymore on the Tth of June, had, up to the battle of Aughrim, on the
1211] of July, lasted but thirty-five (lays, the weather is mentioned to have generally been
warm, or healthy ; and, moreover, that up to the day of the battle, Ginkell is not alleged to
have lost, on the whole, so many as 600 men ; if all these facts be duly connected, and allowed
for, a sufficiently probable, if not a numerically exact, conclusion may be arrived at. as to
which of the two armies was likely to have had the larger amount of men, upon the field of
Aughritn ?

With regard to the three French Protestant regiments of foot and one of horse, which
Colone] O‘Kelly speaks of as “a considerable Party of Protestants out of France, bread up
to Arms, and inured to Warr.‘’ the Colonel‘s eulogium was well merited by them, throughout
this contest. Respecting William [Hes four French regiments in Irelaud, Marshal Schon-
berg, writing to the King from Lisburn, January 9th, 1690, observes, “De ces trois regi-
ments, et de celuy de cavallerye, votre Majeste en tire plus de service, que du double des
autres.'' And, with reference to the general behaviour of those Huguenot corps at Aughrim,
a contemporary Williamite writer, advocating, in 1697, the settlement of French Protestants
in Ireland, enforces his argument by remarking : ‘⁴ I'm sure there must be at least as much
Reason for trusting them to live in Irelaml now, as there was for using their Assistance
against Monsieur St. Ruth at the Battle of Aghrz'm; ancl none, I think, will deny, that they

behav'd themselves very well there''‘'.
