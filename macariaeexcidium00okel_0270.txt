The period of thefall ofIreland arrives, after its alleged existence, as a kingdom, for upward5
of2000 years.

In the period that is here assigned for the “ alleged existence'' of Ireland as an independent
kingdom, till its fall, by the Anglo-Norman invasion, in the twelfth century, our author
would appear to have had in view O'Flaherty’s system of chronology. And, in connexion with
the statement of above 2000 years, sor the destined duration, as it were, of that kingdom,
the writer assudes, perhaps, to the lines in the latter‚or poetica! portion of O'Flaherty’s work:—

ί· Omnia labuntur ; nihil immortale sub astris
Tardius, aut citius, meta statuta venstl‘

off the wife of O’Rourke, Prince ofBrefny.

“ The abduction of the wife of O'Ruarc by the King of Leinster, which took place so
early as the year 1153, has, by the majority of out· historians, been advanced in date, by no
less than thirteen years, for the purpose of connecting it with Dermod's expulsion from his
kingdom, A. D. 1166, and his consequent flight, as we shall see, into England, to solicit aid
from Henry 11. The ready adoption of so gross an anachronism‚ by not a few even of our
own native historiam, may be cited as an instance of that strong tendency to prefer showy
and agreeable fiction to nuth, which has enabled Romanee, in almost all countries, to en-
croaeh upon, and even sometimes supersede, History’'³.

hy the Angla-Narniam, were generally worse used, than when, in similar times, the native
English, or Samus, were treated in lihe manner hy the Normans.
