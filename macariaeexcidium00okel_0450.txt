the diminution of the military power of the Viceroy, occasioned by the arrival of St. Ruth :
⁶· On this Fleet came Monsr St Ruth with other French Officers, as also those gentlemen who
had been iu Franee to sollicite the Duke of Tyrconnell’s removeal 3 which tho the King had
not yeelded too, however had so far given way to their advice as to abridg his power in
reference to the military affairs, the direction of which was vested in a manner wholy in
S* Ruth. So that My Lord Tyrconnel who before could haue made a Lieftenant General,
had not power now to make a Collonel, which so lower’d his credit in the Army that little
regard was had to his authority3 but he prudently submitecL and left the whole management
of it to St Ruth, who seemingly carryd fair, but in the bottom was prepossessed against him,
which those gentlemen that came with him from France had leasure and opertunity to doe.
so that when St Ruth writ to the King for more mony, he desired it might not be remitted
to My Lord Tyrconnel's hands·’1.

On the efforts of King James's officers in lreland. in 1690-91, to weaken William‘s army
by the encouragement of desertion from it, Harris says: “ A Declaration of Brigadier Dor-
rington's‚ dated at Limerick, the 13th of December (wherein he styles him self Governour of
the City and County of Limera-lt) was taken up in the streets of Cashel, intended to inveigle
his Majesty’s army to desert to the Irish quarters. After several invectives against his Ma-
jesty, he promises great things to all who should forsake his service, and such who had no mind
to serve in K. James’s army, should have all necessary accommodations to transport them to
Frmzce . . . . After the Lord Tyrconnel's retm·n from France to Limerick, he also, on the
enh ofJanuary published a Declaration of the like import with that of Col. Dorriugton, but
couched in more modest terms, and founded upon the extremities under which King William's
army laboured for want of pay, promising rewards in Gold and Silver to such as should desert
his service, and conveniencies to transport themselves to France, if they had no mind to serve
K. James.‘’ Harris adds, that “ these temptations had very little effeet.”

But King James observes on that head, notwithstanding the bad condition in which his
forces were, “ It was very wonderful} that the extream miserie and universal wants the Irish
Army was in, should not deterr the Enemie from deserting over to it, which they did in great
numbers 3 and shew'd so general a disposition to it, that My Lord Tyrconnel assured the King,
that had he but so much mony to spare, as would reach a pistole a piece, and subsist them
