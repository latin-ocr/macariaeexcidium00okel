persons of that nation, the Parliament riveted these Acts to that degree of irrevocability‚ that
they brought his Majesty to divest himself of the power of alienating any of these confiscations
from the uses of the Acts, or applying them to any other use whatsoever, tho they left thern-
selves at liberty to employ, as they really (lid thereafter, the most part of the money given in
by the Adventurers, against the King himselfin Englandk, which makes it plain the hidden
view of the party in projecting these confiscations was, to make themselves masters of such a
good beginning of a fund, for carrying on their premeditated war against the King in Eng-
land3 for their rebellion being as yet in its infancy, it was not seasonable they should propose
to raise any considerable sum of money by way of a tax, so the Irish confiscations were the
readiest contrivance they could imagine for their wiclzed purpose.'' A similar representa-
tion of the insurrectionary designs for which this Adventurers' money on Irish confiscations
was principally raised and applied hy the English Parlfflment, is given in King Jumes Hes·
Memoirsl.

When the ruling powers ln England eventually, or on the :zoth of September 1053,
announced Ireland to be reduced to submission, the greater part of the island was thus·
appot-tioned between the above-mentioned Adventurers, or subscribers under those acts of
confiscatiom and the Cromwellian soldiery. At a Couneil of War of the leading Parliainen-
tarian or Cromwellian commanders, ‘⁶ Lord Broghill,'' says his Chaplain, the Rev. Thomas
Morrice, ‘⁴ proposed, that the whole kingdom might be survey'd, and the number ofncres
taken, with the quality of them; and then all the soldiers to bring in their demands of ari-ears,
and so to give to every man, by lot⁷ as many acres of ground, as might answer the valne of their
arrears. This was agreed on 3 and all Ireland being survey'd, and the value of acres given
it, the highest was valued only at four shillings the acre, and some only at a penny. Accord-
ingly they took the names of all that were in arrear, who drew lots in what part ofthe king-
dom their portion should be ; and, in this manner, the whole kingdom was divided among the
eonquerors and adventurers of1noney.'' After the Restoration, the Attorney-General‚ Sir W.
DomviHe, in over-hauling the particular-s of this division of the country, discovered, according
to Carte, among-st other improprieties, that there were “great abuses in the manner ofsetting
out the Adventurers' satisfaction, in which the proceedings were very clandestine and con-
fused. For they had whole Baronies set out to them in gross, and then they employed Sur-
veyors of their own to make their admeasurements, and those finished, they had never since
brought in their surveys or field<bool<s into the Surveyor-General's office, or to publick view.
Thus they had admeasured what proportions they thought fit to mete out to themselves: and
what lands they were pleased to eall unprofitable, they had returned as such, let them be never
so good and profitable. In the County of Tipperary alone, he had found by books in the Sur-
veyor's office above 50‚000 acres returned as unprofitable, and in the moiety of the ten Coun-
ties‚ wherein their satisfaction was set out, he had found 245‚‘207 acres so returned by the

Adventurers as unprofitable;'' διο. then, having shown how very profitable much of this land
