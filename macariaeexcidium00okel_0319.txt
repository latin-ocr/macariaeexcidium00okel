Those oflVorman or English origin, established amongst, and intermarrz'ed with, tloe olcl Irish,
become assimilated z'n names, language, and habits, with the ancient Tace of the country, &⁴0-

The alteration, by the Anglo-Norman or English colonists in Ireland, of their names,
habits, &c.‚ for those of the people among whom they acquired settlements‚ and with whom
so many connexions necessarily arose, began long before the period of the wars of York and
Lancaster, to which the text would attribute the occurrence of such a revolution. That
change is noticed, according to Mr. Hardiman, as having existed amongst the settlers
so early after Henry 112⁵ visit to this country as in 1294-1-295; in the latter of which
years, Edward I.‘s Lord Justice, the Chevalier Jean de Wogan, οι· Sir John VVogan, Kuight,
assembled a colonial Parliament, at Kilkenny, ‘¹ to prevent or remedy these defections.'¹
But, in the next century, during the reign of Edward 11., and for several years before the death
of Edward 111.‚ such “ defections” became “greater then when tenne of twelue. Tribes de-
parted, and fell away from the Kings of luda.'' The Pale, under Edward 111„ also became
tributary to Irish Chiefs; and the constant increase of the above “defection3,“ to the time

of Henry VIII„ appears from the preceding Notea.

On the religious changes in Ire-land, begun in Henry VIII.’s reign, the first Protes-
tant Archbishcp of Dublin, Dr. George Browne, writes thus to the Lord Privy Seal, Crom-
well, April eth, 1538: “ The People of this Nation be Zealous, yet Blind and Unknow—
ing: Most of the Clergy (as your Lordship hath had from me before) being Ignorant, and
not able to speak right &Vords in the Mass, or Liturgy3 as being not skilled in the Latin
Grammar, so that a Bird may be taught to speak with as much Sense as several of them do
in this Country; these Sorts, though not Seholars, yet crafty to cozen the poor Common People‚
and to disswade them from following his Highness's'’ Orders‚” διο.

Further on, the Archbishop observes, in connexion with those changes: ‘⁶ The Romish
Reliques and Images of both my Cathedrals, in Dublin, took off the Common People from the
true Worship; but the Prior and the Dean find them so sweet for their Gain, that they heed
not my Words3 therefore send in your Lordship's next to me an Order more full, and a
