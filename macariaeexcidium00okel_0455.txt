the works to the water side, where they design to attach in going over ..... Our carcasses'
have burnt all the thatched houses in the enemy’s quarters 3 we dismounted all the enemy's
cannon, so that we can now stand almost at the water side to look over. . . .Thirteen squadron

Chaplain, Story, speaks of as going on night and day, Colonel Felix O'Neill, who was present
in the Irish army, in his letter to the Countess of Antrim from Aughrim, July lOth, 1691,
assera, that, previous to the surprise of Athlone by the English on the 30th of June, ‘⁶ the
place was so ruined, and the passages so filled up with lumber and stones, that there was not
room for ⁶2 rnen in a breast to march any way.''

day, says: ‘¹ The Rubbish and Stuff thrown down by our Cannon was more difficult to climb
over than a great Part of the Enemies Works, which occasioned our Soldiers to Swear and
Curse, even amongst the Bullets themselves.“ Nor is this destruction to be wondered at, since,
in referring to Ginkell's great rejoicings after the town was taken, it, remarks the Williamite
Chaplain‚ “had cost us 12000 Cannon Bullets, 600 Bombs, nigh'50 Tun of Powder, and a
great many Tun of Stones, shot out of our Mortem-5⁰¹.
