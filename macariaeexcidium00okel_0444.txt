James ,was, on the retirement of Lord Melfort, appointed, by the Duke of Tyrconnell's inte-
rest, Secietary of State, in the summei of1689, as well as Secretary at War‚ to his Majesty
and retul ned fiom F1ance with the Duk e iu January, 1691, to which he most probably sailed
along with his Gracc, in the French fleet, afte1 the raising of the siege of Lime1 ich leaving
the duties of Secretary to be fulfilled ad interim by Lord Riverston.

The Duke of Berwick, in relating the circumstances which led to the transfer of that post
from Lord Melfort to Sir Richard Nagle, gives Sir Richard this character: ‘¹ Le Chevalier
Nagle. Irlandois, 8: Procureur GeneraL eut a la sollicitation de TirconeL la charge de Secre-
taire d'Etat. C’etoit un tres-honnete homme, de bon sens, & tres-habile dans son mester,
mais nullement verse dans les affaires d‘Etat.'‘

The return of Sir Richard Nagle from France to Limerick, with the Duke of Tyrconnell,
in January, 1691, is thus mentioned in a letter in the State Paper Office, London, from Lieu-
tenant-General Ginkell to the English Secretary at War, Blathxvayt,end0rsed‚ “ To be shewn

The nature of the supply which the Duke of Tyrconnell received from the French Minis-
