Secretary at War, set down, as not less thau 4o‚000 men ! And to these, an addition of several
thousands must, of course, be made for officers, that are not included in the document; which„

quently would not be without some grounds, that, as Colonel O'Kelly intimates, even one of
their inveterate enemies should have spoken of the Irish, as ‘⁴ the most warlick of Nations.‘'

pean nation51. On William's side, we are told, it wasa matter of disputo, how much merit was
due, in this war, to the troops of each of those nations ἶ) Of James⁷s side, this much is certain,

of the Dissertations on the History of Ireland, relates an affecting instance of the melancholy
reverses, in which even the greatest of the old Irish families were involved, by the War of the
Revolution. After describing the character of his uncle's excellent father, Denis O'Conor of
