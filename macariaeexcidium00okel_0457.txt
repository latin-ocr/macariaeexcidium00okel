The French Officers, through overmuch cmfidenee, delay the tz'nzely demolition of the rmn-
part towards the western or C'onnaught side ofAthlone‚ by which, in case of need, troops
from the Irish camp might enter to support those in the town ; though St. Rnth, on finding
Ginlzell heht upon proceedz'ng with his design, at last, or on the evening of June eom,
arder-ed the rampart to he levelled accordingly ; which order, being negleclezl by D* (Vacua,

“ The begining of this missortune‚'' say the royal Memoirs‚ ‘¹ was owcing in great mea-
sure to that spirit of opposition and contradiction, which different humours and intrest are
sure to rais when there is no one that has authority sufficient to make himself be obeyed: on one
hand Mons¹' d'Vson the governonr, would have had a regular garison of choico men fixed in the
place proper to sustain an attack, but St Ruth had a mind to accustom his new raised troops
to fire and discipline, so made them rowle by turns, and as another expedient proposed, that
considering the slightness of the work and the arinys being so near, to demollish the Curtin
on their own side, that a whole battallion might march into the place at once to relieve the
gai-ison and mentain the pass: but Monsr d'Vson in his turn opposed that, saying, Their
business was to defend not demolish forteresses, and was so confident the English would
never attempt so bould an aetion, that he was at breakefast a cannen shot froin the Town when
the Enemie made the assault3 for which S‘ Ruth (laad he lined) would have called him lo (m
account.- he made hast indeed to the Town upon the first alanne, but was born down and run
over by the men that fleds’

According to Colonel Felix O'Neill, St. Ruth gave the order above-mentioned for the.
preservation ofthe town, but it was neglected to be executed by the French Engineers. “ The
French engineers‚'' observes the Irish Colonel, ‘⁵ were more in fault than any, for they were
ordered by the General to rase the works on our side the town, except the trench next the
river, that, whensoever we were attacked, our whole battalion might march, with sword in
hand, to cut off the enemy as fast as they could pass the river.'' That neglect, on the part of
the Engineers, was “an unexcusable false steps continues the Colonel, who, in allusion to
such as were for throwing the blame of the loss of Athlone on St. Ruth, asserts: “ These are
men that would have French Generals cried out upon, and that would willingly discourage all
mankind, nay, accept of conditions, if they knew how.'' Colonel O'Neill, in this last state-

ment, appears to refiect on those who were partizans of the Duke onyrconnell, in opposition
to St. Ruffl‘.
