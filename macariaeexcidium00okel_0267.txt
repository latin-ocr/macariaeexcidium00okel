Misconception as to Irelmzd having been styled the “ Islmzcl quctints,‘' for adhering to the
Roman Catholicfuith, when so many other natium embraced the Protestant religion.

Respecting the state of religion and learning in Ireland from the fifth to the ninth cen-
tury, which procured for the island the title of “Insula Sanctorum et Doctm·um,'' consult
Doctor Lanigan‚ Mr. Moore, and their authorities. On this subject, the learned Camden
says :-“ Patrick‘s disciples made such progress in the Christian doctrine, that, in the next
age, Ireland was called the Cozcntry ⁰f Saints, and no men came up to the Scotch (i. e. Irish)
monks in Ireland and Britain for sanctity and learning; and they sent forth swarms of holy
men all over Europe, to whom the monasteries os Luxueil in Burgundy, Bobbio in Italy,
VVurtzburgh in Franconia, St. Gall in Switzerland, Malnffilnnry, Landisfarn, and many others
in Britain, owed their origin. For from Ireland came Celius sedulius, the presbyter,
Columba, Columbanus, Colman, Aidan, Gall, Killan, Maidulph, Brendan, and many more,
eminent for their life and doctrine. Of these monk5‚ we are to understand Henricus
Antisioderensis‚ before quoted, when he writes thus to Charles the Bald (grandson of
Charlemagne) z ‘ Why should Ι mention almost all Ireland, with its crowd of philosophers,
despising the dangers os the sea, and flocking to our coasts ?' . . . . . The Saxons, also, at
that time, flocked to Ireland, from all quarters, as to a mart ofliterature3 whence we fre-
quently read in our writers os the lives of saints, ‘ such a one was sent over to [reland for
education: ..... From thence, too, our old Saxon ancestors seem to have had the form
of their letters, as they plainly used the same characters, which are at present in use amongst
the Irish. It is not‚'' he adds, “to be wondered at, that Ireland, which is now (A. D. 1607)
for the most part, rude, half barbarous‚ and ignorant of polite literature, should have so
abounded in that age with hely, pious, and illustrious personages, when the cultivation of
learning was neglected, and almost lost throughout the Christian w0r1d; since the divine
Providence scatters the seeds of religion and learning sometimes in one nation, sometimes in
another, as so many beds at different periodS‚ whose produce, being transplanted from one
place to another, yields a new and continual increase, to the glory of God, and the good of
mankind.'’

Colgan observes :—“ In those golden dayS‚ immediately subsequent to the first dissemina-

tion of the faith in our land, and for some ages following, it was regarded not only as a kind
