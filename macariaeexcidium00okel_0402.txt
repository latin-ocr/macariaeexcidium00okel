The defence ofLimerz'ck against Willimn being finally (Iecided upon, according to the opinion of
Brz'gcztlier Sar-field and the majority ostloe Irislz Colonels, the necessary dispositions are

madefor tlze purpose.

King James states, that, on the town being summoned to surrender by William, “there was
some debate about their answer which in their present situation was not to be wonder'd at,
but at last it was resolved to defend the place, and accordingly Mons‘ Boisleau the Governour
writ back to the Prince of Orange's Seeretary (to avoid shocking that Prince too much, by
not giving him the title of King) That he hoped he should merit his opinion more, by a vigo-
rous defenee, than a shamefull surrender osa forteress he had been entrusted with : So prepared
himself acoordingly.⁷’
