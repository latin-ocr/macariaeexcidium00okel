unshaken fidelity neither threats could shake, nor promises corrupt, nor
hopes of advantage change—resolved, either to perish in his cause, or
restore Amasis to his throne; although, whilst his short-lived reign 611-
dured, he was deemed as little disposed as his brother, Pytlzayoras, to

dered to the Viceroy not only the number of soldiers which he had

Quoniam autem Delphicis Religionibus favebat, vetustosque ritus acerrime
propugnabat, illi totis regni viribus praesto esse decreverunt.
