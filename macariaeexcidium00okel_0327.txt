In the document entitled, “ Ibernorum obtestatio non deserendi Catholicam fidem‚‘' pre-
sented to the Lord Deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester, by the Irish Roman Catholic Members of
Parliament, in 1613, after a reference to what the Irish Roman Catholics had to suffer from
the hostility to their religion in the reign of Elizabeth, and an expos? of the penaltics inflicted
by similar hostility under her successor, James I.‚ it is observed, that such rigorous policy
could have no other tendency than that, “veteres incolae extinguantur, perdantur, deleantur:
eorum facultates consumantur, frangantur immunitates odium prouooetur, pariatur seditio,
Sc regno denique excidium, & interitus efferatur.''

In this state of persecution, O'Sullivan Beare add& respecting the Irish Roman Catholic
supporters of the English Government during the Elizabethean war, against their countrymen
os the same religion, and more ancient racc‚—“Ang1ica lbernorun] saone, qnod ipsa Fidei

The descent of Jamcs 1.‚ from the ancient Irish Mmarchs, is alluded to by the King him-
self, in his Speech to the Irish Agents at Whitehall‚ April l2th‚ 1614: “ There is a double
cause why Ι should be careful of the welfare of that (the Irish) people: first, as King of
England, by reason of the long possession the Crown of England hath had in that land; and
also as King of Scotland; for the ancient Kings of Scotland are descendes} from the Kings of
Ireland⁵; so as I have an old title as King of Scotland, therefore you shall not doubt to be
relieved when you complain‚ so as you will proceed without clamour''‘.
