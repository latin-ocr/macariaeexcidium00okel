VVaggoners, and some Country People that were coming to the Camp with Provisions. The
Officer commanding in Chief, when he saw how it was, commanded to sound to Horse, but
those that endeavoured to fetch them up, were killed as they went out, or else saw it was too
late to return: The Officers and others made what Resistance they could, but were at last
obliged every Man to shift for himself, which many of them did, though they lost all their
Herses, and some of them Goods to a considerable Value ι There was one Lieutenant Bell and
some few more of the Troopers killed, with Waggoners and Country People, to the Number
in all of about Sixty. Then the Iri-§lc got up what Horses they could meet withal, belonging
either to the Troops or Train : some broke the Boats‚ and others drew all the Carriages and
XVaggons, with the Bread, Ammunition. and as many of the Guns as they could get in so short
a Time into one Heap 3 the Guns they filled with Powder, and put their Mouths in the Ground
that they might certainly Split3 what they could pick up in a Hurry theytook away, and then
laying a Train to the Rest, which being fired at their going off, blew up all with an Astonishing
Noise ; the Guns that were filled with Powder llying up from the Carriages into the Air, and
yet two of them received no Damage, though two more were split and made unserviceable:
every Thing likewise that would burn, was reduced to Ashes‚ before any could prevent it.
The Iria-lc took no Prisoners, only a Lieutenant of Colonel Eurl's being sick in a House hard
by, was stript and brought to Schzfielcl, who us'd him very civilly, telling him, if he had not suc·-
eeeded in that lintei-prise, he had then gone to Frmzce. Our Party of Horse that was sent
from the Camp, came after the Business was over. in Sight of the Enemies Rear ; but wheeling·
towards the Left, to endeavour to intercept their Passage over the Slzmmon, they unhappily
went another Way ; since, if om· Party had been Fortunate, they had afair Opportunity first
to save the Guns, and then to Revenge their Loss, and if either had been done, the Town had
surrendred without much more Battering.’'
