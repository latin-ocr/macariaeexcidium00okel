The Rev. J. S. Clarke, editor of King James's Memoirs, cites from Dalrymple, in refer-
ence to the first abandonment of James's cause by the “ Assemhly of Peers and Scottish
Gentlemen at Whitehall‚” in Januzzry, 1689, the following remarkable speech of the Earl
of Arran. Dalrymple, after remarking that, in this meeting‚ ⁸‘ but one man alone had the
spuit to speak out their sentiments and hiS own‚⁴' namely, the Earl, gives his speech thus 2—-
“ 1 respect the Prince of Orange as much as any man here does. Ι think him a brave Prince,
and that we all lie under great obligations to him, for delivering us from Popery. But, while
Ι hestow these just praises upon him. I cannot violate my duty to the King, my master. Ι
must distinguish between his Popery and his person: Ι dislike the one3 but have sworn, and
do owe allegiance to, the other. This makes it impossible for me to concur in an address,
which gives the administration of his kingdom 10 another. We are Scottish not English men.
The King's father and grandfather did not abdicate the crown of Scotland even by quitting
their native country3 how then can the King do it by quitting England only? The Prince
asks our advice. My advice is, that we should address him, to invite the King to return, and
call a free Parliament, which may provide, in a constitutional way, for the security of our pro-
perty, liberty, and religion. All other ways are unconstitutional. By this alone, the nation
can avoid present and prevent future discordx·

Dalrymple adds, that, notwithstanding this speech, the Prince os Orange said to the Earl,
“that he respected men of honour, to whatever party they belonged. Yet,'' observes the
historiam, ‘¹ amid this liberality of sentiment, he did not lose sight of prudence; for he soon
after committed Arran to the Tower, under another pretence.” The Scotch writer then
says: ⁴⁶ The I’rince made use of another politic art, with regard to the Scotch. Though the
way from Scotland to London was open to all, the roads from thence to Scotland were. by
his orders, stupped up. Public safety was the pretence for this, But the real intention was,
to detain the Scotch nobility and gentry, until they should kiss hands, upon his elevation to
the throne of England: a ceremony which, it was thought, would, in many, be a pledge of
their acquiescence in his title, lay 1115 enemies open to the suspicions of their own party, and
create an impression in Scotland‚ and still more in England, of the unanimity of the Scotch
in his favour.'’ The Prinee and Princess of Orange were finally sworn as Sovereigns of Scot-
land in London, May ll, 1689, by three Commissioners deputed from the Scotch Parlimnent,
consisting of the Earl of Argyle, as representative of the Lords; Sir James Montgomery, of
the Barons or Knights; and Sir James Dalrymple‚ of the Boroughs of that Kingdom0.
